Bangkok Mobile App Handbook for SMEs

Phones are the default channel for Thai consumers. They book services, pay bills, and message through LINE constantly. A well-scoped app can add convenience and revenue, but only when it fits a real need. This handbook helps you judge necessity, estimate cost and time, and pick a reliable Bangkok development partner.

Do You Need an App or Something Simpler?

Check three points before committing to native builds:
• Will people use this repeatedly?
• Do you need device capabilities like camera, GPS, push alerts, or offline mode?
• Could a responsive website or LINE OA flow cover most of the journey?

Choose accordingly:
• Website/portal — for info, contact, lead capture, and occasional interactions.
• Website + LINE OA + backoffice — for bookings, quotes, and forms when browser/chat is fine.
• Full mobile app — for weekly/daily use, reliance on device features, push notifications, memberships, or complex flows.

A good partner will explore these tracks and might start with a mobile-first web app before full apps.

Typical Thai Use Cases

1) Services/clinics (dental, beauty, fitness, education, small hospitals)
   • Appointment scheduling
   • Push reminders and follow-ups
   • Membership/loyalty records
   • Pre-visit uploads

2) Delivery/on-demand (food, grocery, laundry, courier)
   • Customer ordering
   • Rider/driver job handling and navigation
   • Live status updates
   • Embedded payments and receipts

3) Internal field tools (sales, inspectors, technicians, drivers)
   • Assign/track work
   • Capture photos/signatures
   • Automatic reports
   • Real-time sync to backend

4) Loyalty/membership (restaurants, cafés, gyms, retail)
   • Digital points/stamps
   • Targeted offers
   • Gamified repeat-visit rewards
   • QR-based check-ins

What Shapes Cost

• Scope/features: screens, roles, integrations (maps, payments, LINE, APIs).
• Design/UX: basic layouts vs tailored UI, motion, and brand polish.
• Technology: Flutter cross-platform or native; backend choices like Firebase, Supabase, or custom.
• Quality/maintenance: QA depth, security/performance work, and support plans.

Budget shorthand:
• Simple MVP — lean features, single role, simple backend.
• Medium complexity — multiple roles, custom UI, key integrations, admin portal.
• High complexity — broad feature set, heavy integrations, analytics, security hardening, possibly multi-market.

Expect partners to connect features to costs and push for the smallest valuable first release.

Timeline Basics

1) Discovery & scope — clarify goals, flows, and must-haves. Outcome: agreed v1 scope.
2) UI/UX & prototype — wireframes, branded visuals, clickable prototype. Outcome: flows validated before coding.
3) Development & testing — build app/backend, integrate APIs, run QA. Outcome: device-ready builds.
4) Launch & submissions — prepare assets, submit to Play/App stores, handle reviews. Outcome: published app.
5) Post-launch — fix live issues, ship small improvements, plan next phases. Outcome: steady iteration.

Choosing a Bangkok Partner

Options:
• Freelancer — low cost but single-person risk.
• Agency/small studio — team coverage (PM, design, dev, QA) with structure.
• In-house team — best for ongoing roadmaps but higher fixed cost and management.

Selection criteria:
• Case studies with shipped apps in similar industries or complexity.
• Clear communication linking tech to business value and risks.
• Modern stack (Flutter + cloud backends) for speed.
• Documented process: proposals, milestones, QA, documentation.
• Maintenance: plan for OS/security updates and future features.

Local Insights

• Thai/English bilingual UI with typography suited to Thai script.
• PDPA basics: consent flows, secure accounts, data location considerations (with legal advice).
• Payments: PromptPay, Thai bank transfers, local card gateways, optional regional wallets.
• LINE alignment: login/notifications via LINE, chat support, QR flows for membership/check-ins.

Avoiding Pitfalls

• Assign a single decision owner.
• Keep version 1 lean; split must-have vs later.
• Ask for demos every 1–2 weeks.
• Test with real users before heavy marketing.
• Reserve budget for post-launch fixes/enhancements.
• Hold a long-term vision but validate with an MVP.

Wrap-Up

When you confirm the need, pick a focused use case, and hire a team that understands Thai users, a Bangkok app project becomes manageable. A short chat with a local studio can validate feasibility, outline scope/timeline/budget, and sketch an MVP so you can proceed—or adjust—with confidence.
