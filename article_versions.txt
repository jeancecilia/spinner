Setting Up a Thai Limited Enterprise (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Handbook
Introduction

A Thailand-based Ltd. Organization (Organization Liability-limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common venture structure in Thailand for both within Thailand entrepreneurs and international financiers. It is a private organization form similar to a limited liability organization (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate regulatory entity and liability-limited liability for its owners
siam-statutory.com
. In a Thailand-based Co., Ltd., the firm’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Venture Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees organization sign-up. External investment is regulated by the International Operation Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps external shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this roadmap, we focus solely on the Thailand Private Liability-limited Enterprise (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, lawful criteria, filing milestones, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant statutory references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand-based limited business.

Advantages of a Thailand Restricted liability Firm

A Thailand restricted liability organization offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing operation in Thailand:

Restricted liability Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – financiers risk only the capital they put into the organization
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the firm’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Compliance Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its owners. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct enterprise in its own name without implicating stakeholders in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the business can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The enterprise’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if members change or pass away. The venture can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add financiers or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support operation growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand Market Access with External Participation: A restricted liability organization allows international financiers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thailand-based Treaty of Amity)
siam-compliance.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, overseas shareholders can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered business can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for international employees or executives. Thai liability-limited organizations are the typical vehicle for obtaining commercial endeavor visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the enterprise meets certain capital and within Thailand employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI enterprises or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal venture presence. Many Thailand-based agencies and large businesses prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand liability-limited organization offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling international investment and complying with within Thailand ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular commercial endeavor entity in Thailand.

Lawful Needs for a Thailand-based Restricted liability Organization

Setting up a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involves meeting several statutory conditions, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Partners: You need a minimum of 2 owners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private liability-limited business
library.siam-statutory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Partners can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-statutory.com
. Thai law requires at least two partners to be maintained at all times during the organization’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of members for a private business, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public firm structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. Overseas Ownership: By default, a restricted liability enterprise can be 100% Thai-owned or up to 49% overseas-owned without special permits
siam-lawful.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the enterprise is considered “overseas” under the Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Act (FBA) and may need a External Commercial endeavor License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-compliance.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thai shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thai nominee members (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thailand-based-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand-based partners is required.

Managers: A Thailand-based limited enterprise must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the business
benoit-partners.com
. There is no compliance requirement for a Thai national to be a director – overseas board members are allowed, though in practice a external director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Managers are elected by the partners and have the authority to bind the business in transactions. The board of executives (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the organization and its owners
siam-compliance.com
. The business’s Articles of Association can specify how many board members constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two executives signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director enterprise is also very common for small businesses. Executives need not be partners, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-owned enterprise – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended operation and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the business will employ any international nationals or if it will be majority non-domestic-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a firm needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per international work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a non-domestic-majority business often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a External Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-lawful.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-statutory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-statutory.com
. For example, if you register a business with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the stakeholders initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thai-majority firms, but for external-majority businesses they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a recording fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Firm Name: The business’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Ltd.” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-lawful.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing firms. The name may be in Thailand or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand-based name for recording purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with filing.

Registered Address: Every firm must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where enterprise records are kept and compliance notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for recording – typically a copy of the house enrollment deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the business
siam-lawful.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for recording). Note that after incorporation, if the business moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the enterprise. The MOA must state: (1) the approved organization name, (2) the province where the business will be located, (3) the commercial endeavor objectives of the firm, (4) a declaration that liability of stakeholders is restricted liability, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-compliance.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the firm – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-statutory.com
. The firm objectives can be broad (you can list multiple operation activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have overseas owners, unless you plan to obtain a Overseas Commercial endeavor License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a enterprise may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the enterprise (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of recording (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small enterprises in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with regulatory advice.

Initial Partners and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-regulatory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai organizations (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to owners after incorporation. If any shareholder is a international individual or enterprise, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate paperwork for the filing procedure.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the managers and authorized signatories. Authorized managers are those who can sign on behalf of the enterprise (for example, to sign contracts or bank paperwork). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two executives jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the enrollment application and related filings. Managers will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a statutory requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the enterprise must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the enterprise’s incorporation filings, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many organizations engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the regulatory prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 partners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital obligations especially if international involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the firm filing procedure described next.

Step-by-Step Enrollment Workflow

Setting up a Thai Ltd. business involves several sequential stages with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the method, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Business Name – The first step is to choose a unique business name and reserve it with the Department of Operation Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing firm names, and must end in “Ltd.”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 enterprise days
siam-regulatory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the enterprise using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Enterprise Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the regulatory obligations, includes the business name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for recording. This can be done at the Venture Enrollment office in the province where the firm will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand-based ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA recording is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming forms are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-compliance.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial stakeholders) must be held. If there are only a few partners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the firm’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Leaders is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the organization (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thai law required publishing a notice in a in-country newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few owners). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-compliance.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small enterprises, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (members), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Business (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the business as a regulatory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for business sign-up, attaching required filings: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of partners, details of the newly appointed leaders and their signatory powers, the written consent of the firm’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house filing copy). The board members will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the leaders is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business filing application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA recording (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-statutory.com
, otherwise the step-by-step approach lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the sign-up usually within 1 commercial endeavor day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the business’s recording number and Taxation ID, and a certified list of partners. Congratulations, at this point the business legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Levy ID and Register for VAT – Once the firm is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the business’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your enterprise expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Taxation (VAT). The VAT enrollment is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new firms). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide paperwork such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the enterprise affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT recording should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting enterprise if required by nature of enterprise
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main sign-up, there are a few additional tasks to get your firm fully operational:

Social Security Recording: If you will hire employees (Thai or overseas), you must register your business as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the business affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the business seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a regulatory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your commercial endeavor, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food venture licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For non-domestic-majority businesses, if the operation activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Overseas Venture License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that commercial endeavor
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Overseas Operation Division) and involves a separate application outlining the commercial endeavor plan, justifications, and how the enterprise will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas venture licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward business can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and enterprise enrollment (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Filing system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like tax-related and VAT. By law, the entire step-by-step approach from MOA to organization filing can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online firm filing (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the step-by-step approach. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thai language, engaging a regulatory or accounting firm to assist with filing is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand Ltd. firm is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s taxation laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Takings Levy (CIT): Thailand businesses are subject to corporate earnings fiscal on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive fiscal scheme for small businesses: organizations with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and turnover ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but firms can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate levy return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, organizations must file a half-year taxation return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s levy in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year enterprises). Any withholding tax-related the business has paid or that was withheld from payments to the business can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Fiscal (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the organization must register under the Value Added Tax-related system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the business needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output tax-related collected and input fiscal paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Commercial endeavor Levy depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding taxation on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand enterprise, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% levy respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your business pays dividends to members, a 10% withholding fiscal is applied (for Thailand residents; 10% is also the standard rate for non-domestic members, unless reduced by a levy treaty). You must file monthly withholding tax-related returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for firms) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the firm liable for the tax-related plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the business has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The business needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal takings tax-related withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a firm maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand-based auditor (CPA)
library.siam-compliance.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Every year, the organization must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of owners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-statutory.com
. For example, a firm on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual taxation return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for leaders and dissolution of the firm by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Overseas Venture License Renewals/Reporting: If your organization has a Overseas Enterprise License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI organizations, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the organization enjoys any levy incentives, ensure to comply with their conditions.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the organization’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of managers, changes of organization address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a partners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a stakeholders’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand organization comes with monthly compliance (taxation filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand-based accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thai language (or with Thailand-based translations). Good compliance will keep your firm in good standing and avoid fines or lawful trouble.

External Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for international backers is how Thailand law treats overseas ownership of enterprises, and what additional criteria come into play when hiring overseas staff or having non-domestic managers. Below, we address overseas shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Non-domestic Shareholding Limits – The Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Act: The External Operation Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting non-domestic ownership in Thailand-based organizations
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a firm is considered “overseas” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is external-owned (for juristic owners)
siam-regulatory.com
. International firms are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain venture activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand majority firm.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where non-domestic involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thai enterprises are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. Non-domestic-majority organizations cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal venture activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service venture,” requiring a license if external-owned beyond 49%. If your organization is majority Thailand-based-owned (51% or more Thailand-based stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand-based entity without those restrictions
siam-compliance.com
. This is why some international financiers opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thai partners (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the commercial endeavor is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand nationals from acting as strawmen for overseas control
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of organizations under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Both the Thailand-based proxy and overseas beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thailand-based-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand owners in your enterprise are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% external ownership in a restricted enterprise, here are compliance pathways:

Obtain a Non-domestic Venture License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s External Operation Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your commercial endeavor should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many international organizations do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your operation is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved organizations can be 100% non-domestic-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like levy holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic International Venture Certificate. However, BOI enterprises must meet specific project criteria and are restricted liability to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a enterprise in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-lawful.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-compliance.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your commercial endeavor activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thailand-based majority business doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned enterprise is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of venture to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the commercial endeavor into a Thailand entity for restricted parts and a international entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring External Staff: To legally work in Thailand, international nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand-based limited organization can sponsor work permits for international managers, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The business must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per international work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the external employee is married to a Thailand)
airswift.com
. This is why many enterprises that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The enterprise must employ 4 Thai full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 overseas work permit, you need 4 Thai staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand-based staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per enterprise for standard firms (meaning after 40 Thai employees and 10 foreigners, the enterprise would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The organization should be fully registered and operating, with a real venture address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new businesses, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Fiscal ID and VAT recording if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Enterprises with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand employee rule (BOI businesses can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The organization then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required records include the organization papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience filings of the foreigner. The step-by-step approach typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the business they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The business must continue to meet the Thailand employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a firm would hire an expat for.

For external leaders who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign forms or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many overseas leaders choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a operation visa.

Hiring International Employees: When hiring a overseas employee (aside from executives), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of criteria. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand-based liability-limited business can indeed hire foreigners and have overseas managers, but it must maintain a substantial enterprise presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand-based staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have non-domestic executives living in Thailand, plan your business’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the international individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a business in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Members: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thai partners just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thai authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thailand-based partner, consider the statutory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority overseas ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, venture closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your firm’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing obligations. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed operation should be lawful for your firm to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for external organizations (they expect at least THB 2–3M for non-domestic-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-regulatory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new venture owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and lawful headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (board members, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and levy payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All organization sign-up forms must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a external promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand-based embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thai law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thailand-based stakeholders or executives, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thai friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking In-country Advice: Thailand-based corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated within Thailand resources or statutory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a overseas director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum partners rule changed in 2023
library.siam-statutory.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a international venture license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with tax-related ID numbers, etc. Small enterprises sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the enterprise. Setting up a enterprise is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Lawful References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key compliance references and resources related to Thai liability-limited firms:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing organizations. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of liability-limited firms. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a Ltd. enterprise as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability liability-limited to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-compliance.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by partners within 4 months)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific lawful question on corporate procedures.

International Commercial endeavor Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts international ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for external backers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned firms. It also provides the compliance basis for Overseas Commercial endeavor Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in lawful databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including external-owned organizations), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring non-domestic investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand-based employee criteria (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the lawful context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Venture Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for business recording procedures. While much content is in Thailand-based, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online enrollment). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-recording portal, and lists of acceptable organization objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Overseas Enterprise Division page which explains the International Commercial endeavor License application procedure and conditions.

Thai Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate revenue levy rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides taxation return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for levy compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the method of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease international ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of obligations (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American firms on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the method typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for recording (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer enrollment milestones and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thai business law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with statutory references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thai Limited Firm (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Overview
Introduction

A Thai Restricted liability Enterprise (Business Limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common operation structure in Thailand for both within Thailand entrepreneurs and external stakeholders. It is a private organization form similar to a restricted liability liability firm (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate statutory entity and restricted liability liability for its owners
siam-compliance.com
. In a Thailand-based Co., Ltd., the organization’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is Ltd. to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-lawful.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Operation Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees business sign-up. International investment is regulated by the Overseas Commercial endeavor Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps overseas shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thailand Private Restricted liability Business (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, compliance needs, recording milestones, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant regulatory references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand-based liability-limited organization.

Advantages of a Thailand Ltd. Business

A Thailand-based restricted liability organization offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing commercial endeavor in Thailand:

Ltd. Liability: Stakeholders have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – stakeholders risk only the capital they put into the organization
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the organization’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Lawful Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its members. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct operation in its own name without implicating members in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the organization can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The enterprise’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if members change or pass away. The enterprise can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add stakeholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New owners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support enterprise growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand Market Access with Non-domestic Participation: A limited enterprise allows international shareholders to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-statutory.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, non-domestic shareholders can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered firm can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for overseas employees or executives. Thailand-based liability-limited businesses are the typical vehicle for obtaining venture visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the organization meets certain capital and domestic employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI firms or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand-based clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal commercial endeavor presence. Many Thai agencies and large businesses prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand limited firm offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling international investment and complying with domestic ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular venture entity in Thailand.

Statutory Obligations for a Thailand-based Restricted liability Business

Setting up a Thai Co., Ltd. involves meeting several lawful obligations, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Partners: You need a minimum of 2 owners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private liability-limited firm
library.siam-statutory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Partners can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Thailand-based law requires at least two stakeholders to be maintained at all times during the firm’s existence – if the number falls below two, the enterprise may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of stakeholders for a private firm, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public organization structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. Overseas Ownership: By default, a Ltd. business can be 100% Thai-owned or up to 49% non-domestic-owned without special permits
siam-statutory.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the firm is considered “external” under the Overseas Enterprise Act (FBA) and may need a External Commercial endeavor License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-lawful.com
. We will discuss non-domestic ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand-based shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand-based nominee stakeholders (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand partners is required.

Managers: A Thailand limited enterprise must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no lawful requirement for a Thai national to be a director – overseas board members are allowed, though in practice a external director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Managers are elected by the partners and have the authority to bind the business in transactions. The board of managers (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the organization and its partners
siam-regulatory.com
. The firm’s Articles of Association can specify how many managers constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two leaders signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director enterprise is also very common for small businesses. Executives need not be members, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-owned firm – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended operation and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the firm will employ any external nationals or if it will be majority external-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a business needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per international work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a international-majority business often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a International Venture License for restricted activities
siam-statutory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-lawful.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-lawful.com
. For example, if you register a firm with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the owners initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thai-majority organizations, but for external-majority enterprises they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a filing fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Business Name: The business’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Ltd.” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-compliance.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing firms. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand name for sign-up purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with enrollment.

Registered Address: Every organization must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where enterprise records are kept and statutory notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for enrollment – typically a copy of the house recording deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the enterprise
siam-regulatory.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for recording). Note that after incorporation, if the firm moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the organization. The MOA must state: (1) the approved firm name, (2) the province where the firm will be located, (3) the commercial endeavor objectives of the business, (4) a declaration that liability of partners is Ltd., (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the organization – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-compliance.com
. The business objectives can be broad (you can list multiple venture activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have international members, unless you plan to obtain a International Commercial endeavor License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a enterprise may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the firm (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of sign-up (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small organizations in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Partners and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-regulatory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thailand-based organizations (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to owners after incorporation. If any shareholder is a non-domestic individual or organization, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate paperwork for the recording procedure.

Board members and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the board members and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the organization (for example, to sign contracts or bank records). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two board members jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the enrollment application and related filings. Executives will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a statutory requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the organization must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the enterprise’s incorporation filings, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by stakeholders and authorities. Many businesses engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the regulatory prerequisites for a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 stakeholders, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational forms (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital needs especially if external involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the enterprise filing workflow described next.

Step-by-Step Sign-up Method

Setting up a Thailand restricted liability organization involves several sequential stages with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the procedure, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Firm Name – The first step is to choose a unique enterprise name and reserve it with the Department of Operation Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing business names, and must end in “Ltd.”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 venture days
siam-statutory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the firm using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Operation Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the regulatory needs, includes the business name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for recording. This can be done at the Enterprise Sign-up office in the province where the enterprise will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thai ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA sign-up is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming forms are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-statutory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial owners) must be held. If there are only a few members, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the business’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Managers is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the organization (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand law required publishing a notice in a local market newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few stakeholders). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small businesses, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (stakeholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Organization (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the firm as a compliance entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for business filing, attaching required paperwork: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of stakeholders, details of the newly appointed leaders and their signatory powers, the written consent of the organization’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house recording copy). The executives will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the executives is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The enterprise recording application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA enrollment (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-lawful.com
, otherwise the workflow lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the filing usually within 1 enterprise day – you will then receive the Firm Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the enterprise’s filing number and Tax-related ID, and a certified list of owners. Congratulations, at this point the firm legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Taxation ID and Register for VAT – Once the organization is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the business’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its sign-up number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your firm expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Tax-related (VAT). The VAT sign-up is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new enterprises). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide records such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the organization affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT sign-up should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting venture if required by nature of enterprise
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your enterprise fully operational:

Social Security Sign-up: If you will hire employees (Thailand-based or overseas), you must register your firm as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the enterprise affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the firm seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a compliance requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your venture, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food enterprise licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For non-domestic-majority organizations, if the commercial endeavor activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a External Venture License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that venture
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Non-domestic Operation Division) and involves a separate application outlining the enterprise plan, justifications, and how the commercial endeavor will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas venture licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward business can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and organization filing (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Filing system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire workflow from MOA to firm recording can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online organization enrollment (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the step-by-step approach. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thai language, engaging a compliance or accounting firm to assist with filing is common and can ensure all records are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand restricted liability organization is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s levy laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Turnover Fiscal (CIT): Thai enterprises are subject to corporate takings fiscal on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive fiscal scheme for small businesses: enterprises with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and turnover ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate taxation is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but businesses can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate tax-related return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, businesses must file a half-year taxation return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s fiscal in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year firms). Any withholding levy the organization has paid or that was withheld from payments to the business can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Fiscal (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the firm must register under the Value Added Taxation system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the firm needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output tax-related collected and input fiscal paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Operation Fiscal depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding fiscal on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand-based organization, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% fiscal respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your business pays dividends to stakeholders, a 10% withholding tax-related is applied (for Thailand-based residents; 10% is also the standard rate for external owners, unless reduced by a tax-related treaty). You must file monthly withholding levy returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for enterprises) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the enterprise liable for the levy plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the firm has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The business needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal turnover levy withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thailand law requires that a enterprise maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thai auditor (CPA)
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. Every year, the business must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of owners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, a organization on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-compliance.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual fiscal return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for leaders and dissolution of the enterprise by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

External Commercial endeavor License Renewals/Reporting: If your firm has a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI organizations, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the organization enjoys any levy incentives, ensure to comply with their conditions.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the enterprise’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of executives, changes of organization address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in partners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a owners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a members’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand-based business comes with monthly compliance (taxation filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thai accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thai accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand-based language (or with Thai translations). Good compliance will keep your organization in good standing and avoid fines or statutory trouble.

Non-domestic Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for overseas financiers is how Thailand law treats non-domestic ownership of organizations, and what additional criteria come into play when hiring non-domestic staff or having non-domestic managers. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

International Shareholding Limits – The Overseas Operation Act: The Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting overseas ownership in Thailand-based enterprises
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a enterprise is considered “international” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is non-domestic-owned (for juristic owners)
siam-lawful.com
. Overseas firms are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain commercial endeavor activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand-based majority firm.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where overseas involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thai organizations are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. External-majority enterprises cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Overseas Commercial endeavor License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal venture activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service commercial endeavor,” requiring a license if external-owned beyond 49%. If your business is majority Thai-owned (51% or more Thailand-based stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand-based entity without those restrictions
siam-regulatory.com
. This is why some international financiers opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand stakeholders (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the operation is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand-based nationals from acting as strawmen for external control
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of firms under investigation for nominee structures
Thai-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Both the Thailand proxy and overseas beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand owners in your firm are genuine financiers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% non-domestic ownership in a restricted enterprise, here are statutory pathways:

Obtain a Non-domestic Venture License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Non-domestic Operation Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your operation should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thai employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many overseas organizations do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your venture is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved enterprises can be 100% external-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic External Operation Certificate. However, BOI firms must meet specific project criteria and are Ltd. to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. firm, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a business in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-statutory.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your operation activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thailand majority firm doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned commercial endeavor is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of operation to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the operation into a Thailand-based entity for restricted parts and a external entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring International Staff: To legally work in Thailand, overseas nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand limited business can sponsor work permits for international executives, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The business must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per international work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the overseas employee is married to a Thailand)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The enterprise must employ 4 Thailand full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 external work permit, you need 4 Thailand staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per business for standard firms (meaning after 40 Thai employees and 10 foreigners, the business would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The business should be fully registered and operating, with a real enterprise address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new businesses, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Fiscal ID and VAT recording if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Organizations with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thai employee rule (BOI organizations can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thai, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand-based employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The enterprise then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required filings include the firm papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience paperwork of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the enterprise they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The organization must continue to meet the Thailand-based employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a business would hire an expat for.

For external managers who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign paperwork or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many international managers choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a operation visa.

Hiring Overseas Employees: When hiring a external employee (aside from board members), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of criteria. The firm must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand restricted liability organization can indeed hire foreigners and have international managers, but it must maintain a substantial operation presence to justify it – real capital, Thai staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have non-domestic board members living in Thailand, plan your business’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the international individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a business in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Owners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thai stakeholders just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-based-co.com
Thai-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the regulatory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority non-domestic ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, venture closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your organization’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing needs. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed venture should be lawful for your organization to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for non-domestic firms (they expect at least THB 2–3M for non-domestic-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-statutory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new operation owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and compliance headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (leaders, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and fiscal payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All organization sign-up forms must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a overseas promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand-based law.

Mismanaging Thailand-based Partner Relationships: If you do have Thailand-based stakeholders or executives, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Local market Advice: Thailand corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated within Thailand resources or compliance advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a overseas director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum stakeholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-regulatory.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a non-domestic venture license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with levy ID numbers, etc. Small enterprises sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the enterprise. Setting up a business is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Lawful References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key regulatory references and resources related to Thai restricted liability firms:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing firms. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of liability-limited enterprises. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a limited enterprise as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability restricted liability to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-compliance.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by stakeholders within 4 months)
library.siam-compliance.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific regulatory question on corporate procedures.

Overseas Operation Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts overseas ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for overseas financiers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for international-owned organizations. It also provides the regulatory basis for International Enterprise Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in compliance databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned businesses), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring non-domestic investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thai employee criteria (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the regulatory context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Enterprise Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for organization sign-up procedures. While much content is in Thailand, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online sign-up). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-enrollment portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Overseas Operation Division page which explains the External Enterprise License application procedure and needs.

Thailand-based Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate turnover tax-related rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides tax-related return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for fiscal compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the workflow of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease overseas ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of criteria (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American firms on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the procedure typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for enrollment (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer enrollment checkpoints and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand organization law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with compliance references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thai Liability-limited Enterprise (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Roadmap
Introduction

A Thailand Limited Firm (Organization Restricted liability or Co., Ltd.) is the most common operation structure in Thailand for both local market entrepreneurs and external financiers. It is a private organization form similar to a liability-limited liability business (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate lawful entity and Ltd. liability for its owners
siam-statutory.com
. In a Thailand Co., Ltd., the firm’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is liability-limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand-based Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Venture Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees enterprise filing. External investment is regulated by the External Enterprise Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps external shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thailand-based Private Limited Firm (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, lawful needs, sign-up milestones, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand restricted liability organization.

Advantages of a Thailand Ltd. Enterprise

A Thailand Ltd. business offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing commercial endeavor in Thailand:

Limited Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – shareholders risk only the capital they put into the enterprise
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the firm’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Lawful Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its members. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct commercial endeavor in its own name without implicating partners in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the firm can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The organization’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if stakeholders change or pass away. The venture can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add stakeholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support enterprise growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thai Market Access with International Participation: A restricted liability organization allows external backers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity)
siam-statutory.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, external stakeholders can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered enterprise can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for overseas employees or executives. Thai restricted liability firms are the typical vehicle for obtaining venture visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the firm meets certain capital and domestic employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI businesses or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand-based clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal commercial endeavor presence. Many Thailand agencies and large enterprises prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thai limited enterprise offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling non-domestic investment and complying with in-country ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular operation entity in Thailand.

Compliance Needs for a Thailand-based Ltd. Firm

Setting up a Thailand Co., Ltd. involves meeting several regulatory needs, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key criteria include:

Members: You need a minimum of 2 stakeholders (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private restricted liability enterprise
library.siam-regulatory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-statutory.com
. Stakeholders can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Thai law requires at least two stakeholders to be maintained at all times during the business’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of members for a private organization, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public enterprise structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. Non-domestic Ownership: By default, a Ltd. firm can be 100% Thailand-owned or up to 49% international-owned without special permits
siam-statutory.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the enterprise is considered “non-domestic” under the External Commercial endeavor Act (FBA) and may need a Non-domestic Operation License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-regulatory.com
. We will discuss overseas ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand-based shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand-based nominee members (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thailand-based-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thai partners is required.

Board members: A Thailand liability-limited enterprise must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the business
benoit-partners.com
. There is no regulatory requirement for a Thai national to be a director – non-domestic managers are allowed, though in practice a external director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Board members are elected by the partners and have the authority to bind the enterprise in transactions. The board of leaders (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the business and its stakeholders
siam-lawful.com
. The firm’s Articles of Association can specify how many leaders constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two managers signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director organization is also very common for small businesses. Leaders need not be owners, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thai-owned firm – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended operation and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the enterprise will employ any overseas nationals or if it will be majority non-domestic-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a enterprise needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per international work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a non-domestic-majority business often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a External Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-regulatory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-compliance.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a organization with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the members initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-based-majority organizations, but for international-majority organizations they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a sign-up fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Business Name: The firm’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Ltd.” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-compliance.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing firms. The name may be in Thailand or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand-based name for recording purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with recording.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where firm records are kept and regulatory notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for enrollment – typically a copy of the house sign-up deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the firm
siam-statutory.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for sign-up). Note that after incorporation, if the organization moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the firm. The MOA must state: (1) the approved firm name, (2) the province where the organization will be located, (3) the venture objectives of the business, (4) a declaration that liability of members is liability-limited, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the firm – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-statutory.com
. The enterprise objectives can be broad (you can list multiple operation activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have non-domestic stakeholders, unless you plan to obtain a International Commercial endeavor License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a business may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the business (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of enrollment (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small firms in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Owners and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-regulatory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai firms (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to stakeholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a external individual or firm, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate filings for the sign-up step-by-step approach.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the board members and authorized signatories. Authorized executives are those who can sign on behalf of the enterprise (for example, to sign contracts or bank paperwork). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two board members jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the sign-up application and related filings. Board members will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a statutory requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the firm must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the firm’s incorporation forms, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many firms engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the compliance prerequisites for a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 owners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital obligations especially if non-domestic involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the organization filing step-by-step approach described next.

Step-by-Step Recording Step-by-step approach

Setting up a Thai restricted liability organization involves several sequential stages with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Firm Name – The first step is to choose a unique organization name and reserve it with the Department of Venture Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing business names, and must end in “Limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 commercial endeavor days
siam-compliance.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the organization using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Venture Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the compliance obligations, includes the enterprise name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for filing. This can be done at the Commercial endeavor Filing office in the province where the organization will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand-based ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA enrollment is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming records are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-lawful.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial partners) must be held. If there are only a few stakeholders, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the business’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Executives is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the business (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thai law required publishing a notice in a in-country newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few members). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small firms, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (stakeholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Firm (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the organization as a statutory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for enterprise enrollment, attaching required paperwork: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of stakeholders, details of the newly appointed managers and their signatory powers, the written consent of the business’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house filing copy). The board members will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the board members is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The firm filing application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA sign-up (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-statutory.com
, otherwise the step-by-step approach lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the enrollment usually within 1 venture day – you will then receive the Firm Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the organization’s recording number and Fiscal ID, and a certified list of partners. Congratulations, at this point the firm legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Levy ID and Register for VAT – Once the firm is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the firm’s Taxation ID number is often the same as its recording number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your business expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Taxation (VAT). The VAT sign-up is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new businesses). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide records such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the organization affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT filing should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting commercial endeavor if required by nature of commercial endeavor
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your enterprise fully operational:

Social Security Filing: If you will hire employees (Thai or external), you must register your business as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the organization affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the business seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a compliance requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your enterprise, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food operation licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For external-majority businesses, if the operation activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a International Enterprise License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that enterprise
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s External Operation Division) and involves a separate application outlining the operation plan, justifications, and how the commercial endeavor will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas operation licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward enterprise can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and business recording (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Filing system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire workflow from MOA to enterprise enrollment can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online enterprise filing (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the method. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thai language, engaging a lawful or accounting firm to assist with recording is common and can ensure all records are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand-based Ltd. business is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s tax-related laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Turnover Levy (CIT): Thailand-based firms are subject to corporate turnover taxation on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax-related scheme for small businesses: firms with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and turnover ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but businesses can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate taxation return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, businesses must file a half-year fiscal return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s levy in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year businesses). Any withholding fiscal the business has paid or that was withheld from payments to the business can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Taxation (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the enterprise must register under the Value Added Levy system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the firm needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output fiscal collected and input levy paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Enterprise Taxation depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding taxation on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thai enterprise, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% fiscal respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your firm pays dividends to members, a 10% withholding tax-related is applied (for Thailand residents; 10% is also the standard rate for non-domestic partners, unless reduced by a taxation treaty). You must file monthly withholding fiscal returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for enterprises) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the organization liable for the tax-related plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the organization has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The firm needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal earnings tax-related withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thailand-based law requires that a business maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand auditor (CPA)
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. Every year, the enterprise must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of partners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-compliance.com
. For example, a firm on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-compliance.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual fiscal return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for board members and dissolution of the enterprise by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Non-domestic Enterprise License Renewals/Reporting: If your enterprise has a Non-domestic Venture License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI enterprises, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the firm enjoys any tax-related incentives, ensure to comply with their conditions.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the firm’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of leaders, changes of business address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a owners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a members’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand organization comes with monthly compliance (taxation filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thai accounting standards and levy rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand-based accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand language (or with Thailand translations). Good compliance will keep your organization in good standing and avoid fines or regulatory trouble.

Overseas Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external financiers is how Thailand-based law treats overseas ownership of firms, and what additional obligations come into play when hiring overseas staff or having external leaders. Below, we address international shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Non-domestic Shareholding Limits – The Non-domestic Enterprise Act: The International Operation Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting international ownership in Thailand-based enterprises
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a business is considered “non-domestic” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is non-domestic-owned (for juristic stakeholders)
siam-compliance.com
. International enterprises are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain enterprise activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thai majority business.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where non-domestic involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general backers.

List 3: Activities where Thailand firms are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. International-majority businesses cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Overseas Enterprise License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal enterprise activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service operation,” requiring a license if overseas-owned beyond 49%. If your organization is majority Thai-owned (51% or more Thailand owners), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand entity without those restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. This is why some overseas stakeholders opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand-based partners (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the enterprise is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand-based nationals from acting as strawmen for external control
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of enterprises under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Both the Thailand proxy and non-domestic beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thailand-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand-based partners in your business are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% international ownership in a restricted operation, here are compliance pathways:

Obtain a Overseas Enterprise License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Overseas Operation Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your operation should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thai employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many external firms do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your commercial endeavor is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved businesses can be 100% overseas-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like tax-related holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic International Venture Certificate. However, BOI firms must meet specific project criteria and are restricted liability to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. business, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a firm in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-compliance.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your commercial endeavor activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thailand-based majority enterprise doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned commercial endeavor is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of operation to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the venture into a Thailand entity for restricted parts and a international entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring International Staff: To legally work in Thailand, non-domestic nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thai limited business can sponsor work permits for external managers, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The organization must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per non-domestic work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the international employee is married to a Thai)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The firm must employ 4 Thai full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 overseas work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand-based staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard firms (meaning after 40 Thailand employees and 10 foreigners, the organization would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The business should be fully registered and operating, with a real enterprise address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new enterprises, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Taxation ID and VAT filing if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Organizations with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand employee rule (BOI organizations can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thai employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The organization then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required paperwork include the enterprise papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience filings of the foreigner. The step-by-step approach typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the organization they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The organization must continue to meet the Thai employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a firm would hire an expat for.

For overseas leaders who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign filings or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many overseas executives choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a operation visa.

Hiring Overseas Employees: When hiring a overseas employee (aside from board members), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of criteria. The organization must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand liability-limited firm can indeed hire foreigners and have overseas managers, but it must maintain a substantial venture presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have overseas executives living in Thailand, plan your organization’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the overseas individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a firm in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Partners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand-based stakeholders just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand-based authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-based-co.com
Thai-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thailand partner, consider the statutory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority overseas ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, enterprise closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your firm’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing needs. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed enterprise should be lawful for your firm to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for overseas businesses (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-compliance.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new enterprise owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and lawful headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (managers, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and fiscal payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All firm recording paperwork must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a international promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because filings are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand-based law.

Mismanaging Thailand-based Partner Relationships: If you do have Thailand-based stakeholders or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Domestic Advice: Thailand-based corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated in-country resources or regulatory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a international director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum partners rule changed in 2023
library.siam-compliance.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a international venture license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with taxation ID numbers, etc. Small firms sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the venture. Setting up a firm is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Lawful References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key statutory references and resources related to Thailand-based limited businesses:

Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing enterprises. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of liability-limited organizations. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a restricted liability organization as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability restricted liability to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-compliance.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by stakeholders within 4 months)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific lawful question on corporate procedures.

External Venture Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts external ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for non-domestic financiers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned organizations. It also provides the regulatory basis for Overseas Commercial endeavor Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in compliance databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including external-owned businesses), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring external investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand-based employee conditions (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the lawful context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Enterprise Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for organization enrollment procedures. While much content is in Thai, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online sign-up). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-enrollment portal, and lists of acceptable organization objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a International Venture Division page which explains the Non-domestic Operation License application procedure and obligations.

Thailand-based Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate turnover fiscal rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides fiscal return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for taxation compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the procedure of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease overseas ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of needs (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American firms on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand-based Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for enrollment (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer filing stages and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand business law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with lawful references provided, to ensure accuracy

. By following the guidelines and phases outlined, and leveraging official resources, you can navigate the workflow of setting up a Thailand Limited Firm with confidence. Good luck with your operation venture in Thailand!

Setting Up a Thai Restricted liability Firm (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Roadmap
Introduction

A Thailand-based Liability-limited Firm (Firm Limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common enterprise structure in Thailand for both in-country entrepreneurs and international shareholders. It is a private enterprise form similar to a restricted liability liability business (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate statutory entity and restricted liability liability for its owners
siam-lawful.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the enterprise’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is restricted liability to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-lawful.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thai Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees enterprise recording. International investment is regulated by the Non-domestic Enterprise Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps overseas shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thai Private Ltd. Enterprise (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, statutory conditions, enrollment milestones, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant regulatory references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand liability-limited organization.

Advantages of a Thailand-based Restricted liability Organization

A Thailand-based liability-limited business offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing commercial endeavor in Thailand:

Restricted liability Liability: Partners have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – backers risk only the capital they put into the firm
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the organization’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Regulatory Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its stakeholders. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct commercial endeavor in its own name without implicating owners in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the business can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The firm’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if stakeholders change or pass away. The operation can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add financiers or raise capital compared to partnerships. New members can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support operation growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand-based Market Access with External Participation: A restricted liability business allows non-domestic backers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity)
siam-lawful.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, non-domestic shareholders can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thai laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered enterprise can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for overseas employees or executives. Thailand-based Ltd. firms are the typical vehicle for obtaining venture visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the enterprise meets certain capital and domestic employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI enterprises or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal commercial endeavor presence. Many Thai agencies and large enterprises prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand-based restricted liability business offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling external investment and complying with domestic ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular commercial endeavor entity in Thailand.

Lawful Needs for a Thailand-based Liability-limited Enterprise

Setting up a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involves meeting several lawful conditions, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key obligations include:

Members: You need a minimum of 2 partners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private Ltd. business
library.siam-regulatory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Members can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-statutory.com
. Thailand-based law requires at least two owners to be maintained at all times during the organization’s existence – if the number falls below two, the business may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of partners for a private firm, but if you anticipate many partners or public share offering, a public firm structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. Overseas Ownership: By default, a liability-limited firm can be 100% Thailand-owned or up to 49% external-owned without special permits
siam-lawful.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the enterprise is considered “international” under the International Commercial endeavor Act (FBA) and may need a External Operation License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-compliance.com
. We will discuss overseas ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thai shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand-based nominee stakeholders (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thai partners is required.

Executives: A Thailand-based liability-limited organization must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the business
benoit-partners.com
. There is no compliance requirement for a Thai national to be a director – international board members are allowed, though in practice a non-domestic director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Leaders are elected by the owners and have the authority to bind the business in transactions. The board of managers (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the organization and its members
siam-lawful.com
. The enterprise’s Articles of Association can specify how many board members constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two leaders signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director firm is also very common for small businesses. Executives need not be partners, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-based-owned organization – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended venture and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the organization will employ any overseas nationals or if it will be majority overseas-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a enterprise needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per non-domestic work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a external-majority enterprise often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a External Operation License for restricted activities
siam-regulatory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-compliance.com
. For example, if you register a organization with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the partners initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-based-majority businesses, but for international-majority organizations they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a sign-up fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Enterprise Name: The firm’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Liability-limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-compliance.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing organizations. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thai name for enrollment purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with sign-up.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where firm records are kept and regulatory notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for enrollment – typically a copy of the house filing deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the organization
siam-lawful.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for enrollment). Note that after incorporation, if the business moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the business. The MOA must state: (1) the approved enterprise name, (2) the province where the organization will be located, (3) the enterprise objectives of the firm, (4) a declaration that liability of partners is limited, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the enterprise – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-lawful.com
. The firm objectives can be broad (you can list multiple commercial endeavor activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have international partners, unless you plan to obtain a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a firm may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the firm (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of filing (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small organizations in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Members and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-compliance.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai organizations (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to stakeholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a international individual or firm, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate paperwork for the recording method.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the executives and authorized signatories. Authorized board members are those who can sign on behalf of the business (for example, to sign contracts or bank filings). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two executives jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the filing application and related filings. Board members will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a lawful requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the enterprise must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the business’s incorporation records, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by owners and authorities. Many enterprises engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the compliance prerequisites for a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 members, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational paperwork (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital criteria especially if international involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the enterprise enrollment procedure described next.

Step-by-Step Filing Method

Setting up a Thailand limited business involves several sequential checkpoints with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the step-by-step approach, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Enterprise Name – The first step is to choose a unique business name and reserve it with the Department of Operation Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing firm names, and must end in “Limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 commercial endeavor days
siam-compliance.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the enterprise using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Enterprise Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the compliance needs, includes the business name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for recording. This can be done at the Commercial endeavor Recording office in the province where the business will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand-based ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA enrollment is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming records are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-lawful.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial members) must be held. If there are only a few owners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the enterprise’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Board members is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the firm (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand-based law required publishing a notice in a local market newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few members). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small enterprises, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (owners), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Enterprise (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the firm as a statutory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for firm recording, attaching required paperwork: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of owners, details of the newly appointed managers and their signatory powers, the written consent of the organization’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house enrollment copy). The board members will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the managers is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The organization sign-up application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA recording (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-compliance.com
, otherwise the workflow lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the filing usually within 1 operation day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the enterprise’s sign-up number and Fiscal ID, and a certified list of stakeholders. Congratulations, at this point the organization legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Tax-related ID and Register for VAT – Once the enterprise is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the enterprise’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its filing number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your firm expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Fiscal (VAT). The VAT sign-up is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new organizations). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide filings such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the organization affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT filing should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting venture if required by nature of operation
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main enrollment, there are a few additional tasks to get your organization fully operational:

Social Security Recording: If you will hire employees (Thailand or non-domestic), you must register your firm as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the enterprise affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the organization seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a lawful requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your enterprise, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food venture licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For overseas-majority businesses, if the venture activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Non-domestic Operation License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that venture
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Overseas Enterprise Division) and involves a separate application outlining the commercial endeavor plan, justifications, and how the venture will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas operation licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward firm can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and business enrollment (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Recording system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like taxation and VAT. By law, the entire procedure from MOA to enterprise enrollment can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online enterprise sign-up (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the workflow. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand language, engaging a compliance or accounting firm to assist with sign-up is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand restricted liability firm is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s levy laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Turnover Levy (CIT): Thai enterprises are subject to corporate turnover taxation on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax-related scheme for small businesses: businesses with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and earnings ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate fiscal is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but organizations can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate fiscal return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, organizations must file a half-year fiscal return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s levy in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year organizations). Any withholding taxation the organization has paid or that was withheld from payments to the firm can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Fiscal (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the firm must register under the Value Added Fiscal system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the business needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output taxation collected and input levy paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Venture Taxation depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding levy on certain payments. For example, when your business pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand firm, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% tax-related respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your business pays dividends to stakeholders, a 10% withholding tax-related is applied (for Thailand-based residents; 10% is also the standard rate for overseas owners, unless reduced by a taxation treaty). You must file monthly withholding tax-related returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for enterprises) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the enterprise liable for the tax-related plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the firm has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The business needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal takings fiscal withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thailand-based law requires that a enterprise maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thai auditor (CPA)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Every year, the firm must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of partners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, a organization on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual taxation return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for managers and dissolution of the firm by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

External Operation License Renewals/Reporting: If your firm has a Overseas Venture License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI enterprises, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the business enjoys any fiscal incentives, ensure to comply with their obligations.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the firm’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of board members, changes of business address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in members. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a partners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a partners’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thai organization comes with monthly compliance (levy filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thai accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thai accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand language (or with Thailand translations). Good compliance will keep your enterprise in good standing and avoid fines or regulatory trouble.

External Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external backers is how Thai law treats external ownership of organizations, and what additional obligations come into play when hiring non-domestic staff or having non-domestic managers. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Non-domestic Shareholding Limits – The Overseas Operation Act: The International Enterprise Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting external ownership in Thailand-based enterprises
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a organization is considered “external” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is non-domestic-owned (for juristic owners)
siam-regulatory.com
. Non-domestic firms are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain venture activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand-based majority enterprise.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where non-domestic involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thailand enterprises are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. International-majority businesses cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a International Operation License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal commercial endeavor activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service operation,” requiring a license if external-owned beyond 49%. If your firm is majority Thailand-owned (51% or more Thailand-based partners), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand-based entity without those restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. This is why some overseas backers opt for Thai partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand partners (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand-based nationals from acting as strawmen for non-domestic control
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of businesses under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Both the Thailand proxy and overseas beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thailand-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand partners in your business are genuine shareholders with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% non-domestic ownership in a restricted venture, here are regulatory pathways:

Obtain a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Overseas Operation Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your operation should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thai employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many international businesses do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your venture is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved enterprises can be 100% external-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic Overseas Operation Certificate. However, BOI organizations must meet specific project criteria and are Ltd. to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a enterprise in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-regulatory.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-compliance.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your enterprise activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority firm doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned operation is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of operation to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the commercial endeavor into a Thai entity for restricted parts and a non-domestic entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring Overseas Staff: To legally work in Thailand, non-domestic nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand liability-limited enterprise can sponsor work permits for external leaders, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The firm must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per overseas work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the overseas employee is married to a Thailand-based)
airswift.com
. This is why many businesses that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The business must employ 4 Thai full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 international work permit, you need 4 Thai staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thai staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per enterprise for standard enterprises (meaning after 40 Thailand employees and 10 foreigners, the organization would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The firm should be fully registered and operating, with a real commercial endeavor address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new organizations, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Levy ID and VAT sign-up if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Organizations with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand employee rule (BOI organizations can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand-based employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The firm then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required forms include the business papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience forms of the foreigner. The procedure typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the organization they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and business stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The firm must continue to meet the Thailand-based employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a enterprise would hire an expat for.

For international board members who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign forms or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many overseas board members choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a operation visa.

Hiring Overseas Employees: When hiring a non-domestic employee (aside from board members), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of obligations. The organization must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand-based liability-limited business can indeed hire foreigners and have international managers, but it must maintain a substantial operation presence to justify it – real capital, Thai staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have non-domestic managers living in Thailand, plan your organization’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a enterprise in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Owners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand members just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thailand partner, consider the regulatory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority non-domestic ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, commercial endeavor closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your firm’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing criteria. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed commercial endeavor should be lawful for your business to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for external organizations (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-statutory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new operation owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and lawful headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (managers, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and levy payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All firm recording paperwork must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a international promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thailand-based partners or leaders, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand-based friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Local market Advice: Thailand corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated within Thailand resources or regulatory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a international director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum owners rule changed in 2023
library.siam-regulatory.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a external venture license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with taxation ID numbers, etc. Small enterprises sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the commercial endeavor. Setting up a firm is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Lawful References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key compliance references and resources related to Thailand limited organizations:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing enterprises. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of liability-limited businesses. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a liability-limited business as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability limited to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by members within 4 months)
library.siam-compliance.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific statutory question on corporate procedures.

Non-domestic Operation Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts overseas ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for international backers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for international-owned businesses. It also provides the compliance basis for Overseas Venture Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in regulatory databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including non-domestic-owned enterprises), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thai citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring international investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand employee obligations (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the statutory context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for firm recording procedures. While much content is in Thailand, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online filing). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-recording portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Overseas Commercial endeavor Division page which explains the External Operation License application method and criteria.

Thailand-based Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate revenue levy rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides fiscal return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for tax-related compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the step-by-step approach of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease overseas ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of conditions (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American businesses on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand-based Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for recording (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer sign-up checkpoints and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand enterprise law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with regulatory references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thailand Restricted liability Enterprise (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Handbook
Introduction

A Thailand-based Liability-limited Firm (Business Limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common commercial endeavor structure in Thailand for both within Thailand entrepreneurs and overseas financiers. It is a private firm form similar to a liability-limited liability firm (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate lawful entity and Ltd. liability for its owners
siam-regulatory.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the organization’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is liability-limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thai Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Enterprise Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees business sign-up. International investment is regulated by the International Operation Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps overseas shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thai Private Restricted liability Enterprise (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, lawful criteria, sign-up phases, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand-based limited enterprise.

Advantages of a Thailand-based Liability-limited Business

A Thailand-based limited enterprise offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing commercial endeavor in Thailand:

Limited Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – backers risk only the capital they put into the enterprise
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the enterprise’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Regulatory Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its stakeholders. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct commercial endeavor in its own name without implicating owners in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the organization can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The organization’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if owners change or pass away. The venture can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add stakeholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support commercial endeavor growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand-based Market Access with International Participation: A Ltd. enterprise allows external backers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-compliance.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-lawful.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, overseas backers can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thai laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered organization can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for non-domestic employees or executives. Thailand restricted liability enterprises are the typical vehicle for obtaining enterprise visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the firm meets certain capital and in-country employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI enterprises or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thai clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal enterprise presence. Many Thai agencies and large businesses prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand-based restricted liability business offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling non-domestic investment and complying with in-country ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular venture entity in Thailand.

Regulatory Conditions for a Thailand-based Liability-limited Firm

Setting up a Thailand Co., Ltd. involves meeting several lawful conditions, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Owners: You need a minimum of 2 partners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private limited organization
library.siam-statutory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Members can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Thailand-based law requires at least two stakeholders to be maintained at all times during the business’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of partners for a private organization, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public business structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thai vs. Overseas Ownership: By default, a Ltd. firm can be 100% Thai-owned or up to 49% external-owned without special permits
siam-regulatory.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the business is considered “international” under the External Commercial endeavor Act (FBA) and may need a Overseas Enterprise License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-lawful.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand-based shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand nominee members (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thailand-based-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand-based partners is required.

Executives: A Thailand-based liability-limited firm must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the organization
benoit-partners.com
. There is no lawful requirement for a Thailand national to be a director – external leaders are allowed, though in practice a overseas director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Board members are elected by the stakeholders and have the authority to bind the enterprise in transactions. The board of leaders (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the firm and its members
siam-statutory.com
. The enterprise’s Articles of Association can specify how many leaders constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two leaders signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director organization is also very common for small businesses. Leaders need not be members, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-based-owned business – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended venture and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the organization will employ any non-domestic nationals or if it will be majority non-domestic-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a enterprise needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per external work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a non-domestic-majority enterprise often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-compliance.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-lawful.com
. For example, if you register a organization with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the members initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-based-majority businesses, but for overseas-majority businesses they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a recording fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Organization Name: The enterprise’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-compliance.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing organizations. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand name for recording purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with enrollment.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where business records are kept and compliance notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for sign-up – typically a copy of the house sign-up deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the business
siam-statutory.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for filing). Note that after incorporation, if the business moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the business. The MOA must state: (1) the approved firm name, (2) the province where the business will be located, (3) the venture objectives of the enterprise, (4) a declaration that liability of owners is Ltd., (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the organization – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-compliance.com
. The enterprise objectives can be broad (you can list multiple enterprise activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have international owners, unless you plan to obtain a Overseas Commercial endeavor License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a firm may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the enterprise (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of filing (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small enterprises in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with compliance advice.

Initial Partners and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-regulatory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai enterprises (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to partners after incorporation. If any shareholder is a non-domestic individual or enterprise, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate filings for the recording workflow.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the executives and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the organization (for example, to sign contracts or bank records). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two managers jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the filing application and related filings. Executives will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a lawful requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the business must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the firm’s incorporation filings, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many organizations engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the statutory prerequisites for a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 owners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital needs especially if external involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the organization sign-up method described next.

Step-by-Step Recording Method

Setting up a Thailand Ltd. organization involves several sequential phases with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the step-by-step approach, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Enterprise Name – The first step is to choose a unique organization name and reserve it with the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing organization names, and must end in “Limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 commercial endeavor days
siam-regulatory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the organization using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Commercial endeavor Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the lawful needs, includes the firm name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for enrollment. This can be done at the Enterprise Sign-up office in the province where the enterprise will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thai ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA sign-up is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming forms are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-statutory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-compliance.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial members) must be held. If there are only a few owners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the organization’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Board members is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the business (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand-based law required publishing a notice in a in-country newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few owners). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small enterprises, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (stakeholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Organization (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the firm as a statutory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for business recording, attaching required filings: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of members, details of the newly appointed leaders and their signatory powers, the written consent of the firm’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house filing copy). The leaders will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the leaders is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business enrollment application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA enrollment (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-regulatory.com
, otherwise the method lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the enrollment usually within 1 operation day – you will then receive the Firm Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the organization’s filing number and Tax-related ID, and a certified list of stakeholders. Congratulations, at this point the organization legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Tax-related ID and Register for VAT – Once the business is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the enterprise’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your enterprise expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Taxation (VAT). The VAT filing is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new enterprises). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide forms such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the enterprise affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT sign-up should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting operation if required by nature of enterprise
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your enterprise fully operational:

Social Security Sign-up: If you will hire employees (Thailand-based or international), you must register your firm as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the business affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the enterprise seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a statutory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your venture, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food venture licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For non-domestic-majority organizations, if the venture activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a External Enterprise License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that venture
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s International Venture Division) and involves a separate application outlining the operation plan, justifications, and how the venture will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas commercial endeavor licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward organization can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and business sign-up (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Sign-up system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like tax-related and VAT. By law, the entire workflow from MOA to firm sign-up can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online firm enrollment (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the method. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand language, engaging a statutory or accounting firm to assist with recording is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand limited organization is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s levy laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Revenue Tax-related (CIT): Thai enterprises are subject to corporate turnover tax-related on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive fiscal scheme for small businesses: enterprises with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and revenue ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but enterprises can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate levy return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, enterprises must file a half-year levy return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s fiscal in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year firms). Any withholding levy the enterprise has paid or that was withheld from payments to the enterprise can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Levy (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the business must register under the Value Added Fiscal system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the organization needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output tax-related collected and input levy paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Operation Taxation depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding fiscal on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand firm, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% taxation respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your firm pays dividends to stakeholders, a 10% withholding levy is applied (for Thailand-based residents; 10% is also the standard rate for external stakeholders, unless reduced by a fiscal treaty). You must file monthly withholding taxation returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for firms) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the organization liable for the taxation plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the business has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The organization needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal earnings taxation withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a organization maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thai auditor (CPA)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. Every year, the enterprise must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of owners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, a enterprise on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual tax-related return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for executives and dissolution of the business by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License Renewals/Reporting: If your organization has a Non-domestic Venture License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI businesses, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the business enjoys any tax-related incentives, ensure to comply with their obligations.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the firm’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of board members, changes of firm address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a owners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a owners’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thai organization comes with monthly compliance (tax-related filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thai accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand-based language (or with Thailand-based translations). Good compliance will keep your enterprise in good standing and avoid fines or compliance trouble.

Non-domestic Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external financiers is how Thai law treats overseas ownership of businesses, and what additional criteria come into play when hiring international staff or having non-domestic executives. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Overseas Shareholding Limits – The Non-domestic Venture Act: The Non-domestic Operation Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting non-domestic ownership in Thailand businesses
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a firm is considered “external” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is international-owned (for juristic members)
siam-regulatory.com
. Non-domestic firms are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain venture activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand majority organization.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where external involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thai enterprises are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. Non-domestic-majority organizations cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Overseas Operation License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal venture activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service operation,” requiring a license if international-owned beyond 49%. If your business is majority Thailand-owned (51% or more Thai stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand entity without those restrictions
siam-regulatory.com
. This is why some non-domestic shareholders opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand-based members (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand nationals from acting as strawmen for external control
Thai-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of businesses under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Both the Thai proxy and external beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thailand-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand-based partners in your organization are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% external ownership in a restricted enterprise, here are lawful pathways:

Obtain a International Venture License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Non-domestic Venture Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your venture should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thai employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many external firms do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your enterprise is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved firms can be 100% overseas-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic External Enterprise Certificate. However, BOI firms must meet specific project criteria and are limited to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand-based Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a organization in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-regulatory.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your venture activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority business doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned enterprise is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of operation to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the operation into a Thai entity for restricted parts and a non-domestic entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring International Staff: To legally work in Thailand, international nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand liability-limited firm can sponsor work permits for overseas board members, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The organization must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per non-domestic work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the external employee is married to a Thailand-based)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The business must employ 4 Thailand full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 international work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard businesses (meaning after 40 Thailand employees and 10 foreigners, the firm would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The business should be fully registered and operating, with a real commercial endeavor address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new organizations, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Taxation ID and VAT recording if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Organizations with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand-based employee rule (BOI businesses can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thai, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The firm then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required forms include the business papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience paperwork of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the business they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The firm must continue to meet the Thailand-based employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a business would hire an expat for.

For international managers who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign filings or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many non-domestic board members choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a venture visa.

Hiring External Employees: When hiring a non-domestic employee (aside from executives), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of obligations. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand liability-limited firm can indeed hire foreigners and have external managers, but it must maintain a substantial operation presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have international board members living in Thailand, plan your organization’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a firm in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Stakeholders: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand owners just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand-based authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thai-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the lawful routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority non-domestic ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, enterprise closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your enterprise’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing conditions. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed venture should be lawful for your firm to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for international firms (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-statutory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new operation owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and regulatory headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (executives, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and fiscal payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All firm sign-up forms must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a overseas promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand-based embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand-based law.

Mismanaging Thailand-based Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai owners or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thai partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking In-country Advice: Thailand corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated local market resources or lawful advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a external director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum stakeholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-compliance.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a international commercial endeavor license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with fiscal ID numbers, etc. Small organizations sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the operation. Setting up a organization is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Compliance References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key lawful references and resources related to Thailand-based limited businesses:

Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing organizations. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of Ltd. firms. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a limited business as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-lawful.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by partners within 4 months)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific regulatory question on corporate procedures.

External Enterprise Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts overseas ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for overseas stakeholders to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned enterprises. It also provides the regulatory basis for Overseas Commercial endeavor Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in regulatory databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring external investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand-based employee conditions (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the lawful context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for business filing procedures. While much content is in Thailand-based, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online enrollment). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-enrollment portal, and lists of acceptable business objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a External Venture Division page which explains the Non-domestic Operation License application step-by-step approach and needs.

Thailand Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate turnover taxation rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides levy return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for tax-related compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the procedure of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease international ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of criteria (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American organizations on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thai Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for enrollment (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer recording checkpoints and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand organization law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with compliance references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thailand Limited Organization (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Overview
Introduction

A Thai Limited Business (Organization Restricted liability or Co., Ltd.) is the most common commercial endeavor structure in Thailand for both domestic entrepreneurs and non-domestic financiers. It is a private business form similar to a Ltd. liability firm (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate lawful entity and restricted liability liability for its owners
siam-statutory.com
. In a Thailand-based Co., Ltd., the enterprise’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-regulatory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand-based Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees organization enrollment. Overseas investment is regulated by the Non-domestic Venture Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps international shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thailand Private Restricted liability Organization (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, lawful obligations, recording phases, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand-based restricted liability firm.

Advantages of a Thai Liability-limited Firm

A Thailand restricted liability enterprise offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing operation in Thailand:

Ltd. Liability: Stakeholders have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – shareholders risk only the capital they put into the business
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the business’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Statutory Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its owners. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct operation in its own name without implicating partners in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the enterprise can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The enterprise’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if members change or pass away. The enterprise can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add financiers or raise capital compared to partnerships. New members can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support operation growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand Market Access with External Participation: A limited business allows external financiers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thailand-based Treaty of Amity)
siam-lawful.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, international financiers can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand-based laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered organization can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for international employees or executives. Thailand Ltd. organizations are the typical vehicle for obtaining commercial endeavor visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the organization meets certain capital and domestic employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI businesses or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal commercial endeavor presence. Many Thailand-based agencies and large organizations prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand liability-limited firm offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling international investment and complying with domestic ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular commercial endeavor entity in Thailand.

Regulatory Criteria for a Thailand-based Ltd. Enterprise

Setting up a Thailand Co., Ltd. involves meeting several regulatory needs, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Stakeholders: You need a minimum of 2 members (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private Ltd. organization
library.siam-compliance.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Stakeholders can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-compliance.com
. Thailand-based law requires at least two stakeholders to be maintained at all times during the enterprise’s existence – if the number falls below two, the enterprise may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of owners for a private organization, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public enterprise structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. External Ownership: By default, a Ltd. business can be 100% Thailand-based-owned or up to 49% international-owned without special permits
siam-compliance.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the firm is considered “overseas” under the International Venture Act (FBA) and may need a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-compliance.com
. We will discuss international ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thai shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thai nominee members (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand-based partners is required.

Executives: A Thai Ltd. business must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no regulatory requirement for a Thailand-based national to be a director – overseas managers are allowed, though in practice a non-domestic director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Managers are elected by the partners and have the authority to bind the firm in transactions. The board of board members (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the firm and its stakeholders
siam-compliance.com
. The firm’s Articles of Association can specify how many board members constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two managers signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director firm is also very common for small businesses. Managers need not be members, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-owned organization – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended enterprise and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the firm will employ any overseas nationals or if it will be majority overseas-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a organization needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per external work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a external-majority enterprise often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a External Venture License for restricted activities
siam-regulatory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a enterprise with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the partners initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thai-majority enterprises, but for non-domestic-majority enterprises they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a filing fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Organization Name: The organization’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Restricted liability” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-statutory.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing businesses. The name may be in Thailand or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand name for sign-up purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with enrollment.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where enterprise records are kept and regulatory notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for enrollment – typically a copy of the house enrollment deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the business
siam-compliance.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for recording). Note that after incorporation, if the firm moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the business. The MOA must state: (1) the approved firm name, (2) the province where the organization will be located, (3) the operation objectives of the organization, (4) a declaration that liability of stakeholders is limited, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the enterprise – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-statutory.com
. The business objectives can be broad (you can list multiple operation activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have overseas members, unless you plan to obtain a Overseas Enterprise License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a business may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the business (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of sign-up (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small organizations in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Members and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-lawful.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thailand firms (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to stakeholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a overseas individual or enterprise, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate forms for the filing procedure.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the managers and authorized signatories. Authorized managers are those who can sign on behalf of the enterprise (for example, to sign contracts or bank filings). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two managers jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the sign-up application and related filings. Managers will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a lawful requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the organization must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the firm’s incorporation paperwork, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many firms engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the compliance prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 partners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational paperwork (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital conditions especially if international involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the firm sign-up method described next.

Step-by-Step Sign-up Step-by-step approach

Setting up a Thai Ltd. firm involves several sequential stages with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Organization Name – The first step is to choose a unique firm name and reserve it with the Department of Venture Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing business names, and must end in “Limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 venture days
siam-compliance.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the enterprise using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Commercial endeavor Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the compliance criteria, includes the business name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for sign-up. This can be done at the Commercial endeavor Enrollment office in the province where the enterprise will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA recording is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming paperwork are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-statutory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial members) must be held. If there are only a few partners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the business’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Board members is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the enterprise (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand law required publishing a notice in a in-country newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few stakeholders). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-statutory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small enterprises, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (owners), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Firm (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the firm as a regulatory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for firm filing, attaching required paperwork: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of stakeholders, details of the newly appointed leaders and their signatory powers, the written consent of the firm’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house recording copy). The managers will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the managers is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business filing application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA sign-up (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-lawful.com
, otherwise the method lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the filing usually within 1 enterprise day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the enterprise’s sign-up number and Fiscal ID, and a certified list of partners. Congratulations, at this point the business legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Tax-related ID and Register for VAT – Once the firm is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the business’s Taxation ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your business expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Taxation (VAT). The VAT sign-up is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new organizations). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide forms such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the organization affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT filing should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting operation if required by nature of enterprise
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main sign-up, there are a few additional tasks to get your organization fully operational:

Social Security Enrollment: If you will hire employees (Thailand-based or external), you must register your enterprise as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the enterprise affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the business seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a regulatory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your commercial endeavor, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food commercial endeavor licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For overseas-majority firms, if the commercial endeavor activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Overseas Venture License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that enterprise
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Overseas Venture Division) and involves a separate application outlining the operation plan, justifications, and how the enterprise will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss external operation licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward business can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and firm filing (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Recording system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire method from MOA to enterprise enrollment can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online enterprise sign-up (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the procedure. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thai language, engaging a lawful or accounting firm to assist with enrollment is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thai limited business is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s fiscal laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Takings Levy (CIT): Thailand businesses are subject to corporate earnings levy on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive levy scheme for small businesses: businesses with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and turnover ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate tax-related is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but firms can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate levy return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, organizations must file a half-year levy return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s fiscal in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year businesses). Any withholding fiscal the enterprise has paid or that was withheld from payments to the firm can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Fiscal (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the firm must register under the Value Added Taxation system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the firm needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output tax-related collected and input tax-related paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Commercial endeavor Taxation depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding taxation on certain payments. For example, when your enterprise pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand firm, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% tax-related respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your enterprise pays dividends to partners, a 10% withholding fiscal is applied (for Thai residents; 10% is also the standard rate for overseas members, unless reduced by a tax-related treaty). You must file monthly withholding tax-related returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for firms) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the business liable for the taxation plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the organization has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The enterprise needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal revenue levy withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thailand law requires that a organization maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand-based auditor (CPA)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. Every year, the firm must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of stakeholders within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-lawful.com
. For example, a business on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-compliance.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual fiscal return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for leaders and dissolution of the enterprise by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License Renewals/Reporting: If your organization has a International Operation License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI firms, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the organization enjoys any fiscal incentives, ensure to comply with their criteria.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the firm’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of leaders, changes of firm address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a members’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a owners’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thai enterprise comes with monthly compliance (taxation filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand-based accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand-based language (or with Thai translations). Good compliance will keep your business in good standing and avoid fines or statutory trouble.

International Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for non-domestic shareholders is how Thailand-based law treats overseas ownership of organizations, and what additional criteria come into play when hiring external staff or having external leaders. Below, we address international shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

International Shareholding Limits – The External Venture Act: The Overseas Enterprise Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting non-domestic ownership in Thai firms
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a organization is considered “non-domestic” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is non-domestic-owned (for juristic members)
siam-regulatory.com
. External enterprises are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain venture activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand majority organization.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where overseas involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general stakeholders.

List 3: Activities where Thai enterprises are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. International-majority firms cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a International Venture License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal enterprise activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service enterprise,” requiring a license if international-owned beyond 49%. If your business is majority Thailand-owned (51% or more Thailand-based members), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thai entity without those restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. This is why some non-domestic stakeholders opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand-based stakeholders (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand nationals from acting as strawmen for international control
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of organizations under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Both the Thailand-based proxy and overseas beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thai stakeholders in your business are genuine shareholders with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% non-domestic ownership in a restricted venture, here are statutory pathways:

Obtain a Non-domestic Operation License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s International Venture Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your enterprise should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand-based employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many external businesses do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your venture is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved enterprises can be 100% overseas-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like levy holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic Overseas Venture Certificate. However, BOI firms must meet specific project criteria and are liability-limited to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. enterprise, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a organization in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-compliance.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-compliance.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your enterprise activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thailand-based majority organization doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned operation is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of operation to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the venture into a Thai entity for restricted parts and a overseas entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring External Staff: To legally work in Thailand, overseas nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand restricted liability organization can sponsor work permits for non-domestic managers, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The business must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per international work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the external employee is married to a Thai)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The firm must employ 4 Thailand full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 international work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand-based staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard enterprises (meaning after 40 Thailand-based employees and 10 foreigners, the organization would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The enterprise should be fully registered and operating, with a real commercial endeavor address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new enterprises, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Taxation ID and VAT filing if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Businesses with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand-based employee rule (BOI enterprises can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The organization then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required records include the firm papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience forms of the foreigner. The workflow typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the enterprise they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and organization stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The organization must continue to meet the Thailand-based employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a firm would hire an expat for.

For external executives who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign forms or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many international board members choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a venture visa.

Hiring External Employees: When hiring a external employee (aside from board members), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of obligations. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand-based liability-limited business can indeed hire foreigners and have external managers, but it must maintain a substantial venture presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand-based staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have international board members living in Thailand, plan your enterprise’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the overseas individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a enterprise in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Members: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand-based members just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thai-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thailand-based partner, consider the compliance routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority non-domestic ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, operation closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your organization’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing conditions. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed venture should be lawful for your firm to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for overseas firms (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-statutory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new enterprise owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and statutory headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (executives, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and tax-related payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All enterprise filing records must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a overseas promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand-based embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thai law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai owners or leaders, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand-based friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thai partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking In-country Advice: Thailand-based corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated in-country resources or lawful advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a non-domestic director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum members rule changed in 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a international operation license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with levy ID numbers, etc. Small organizations sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the venture. Setting up a organization is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Statutory References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key statutory references and resources related to Thailand limited firms:

Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing businesses. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of limited organizations. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a restricted liability business as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-lawful.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-lawful.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by members within 4 months)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific lawful question on corporate procedures.

International Venture Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts non-domestic ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for international financiers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned businesses. It also provides the compliance basis for External Venture Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in compliance databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned businesses), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring overseas investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand employee conditions (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the compliance context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for organization enrollment procedures. While much content is in Thailand-based, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online sign-up). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-sign-up portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Overseas Enterprise Division page which explains the Non-domestic Venture License application step-by-step approach and conditions.

Thailand Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate takings tax-related rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides tax-related return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for fiscal compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the method of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease non-domestic ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of criteria (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American enterprises on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the workflow typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for filing (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer sign-up stages and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thai firm law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with lawful references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thailand-based Liability-limited Organization (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Handbook
Introduction

A Thai Limited Enterprise (Firm Liability-limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common venture structure in Thailand for both domestic entrepreneurs and external financiers. It is a private firm form similar to a liability-limited liability firm (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate compliance entity and limited liability for its owners
siam-statutory.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the firm’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is Ltd. to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thai Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Venture Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees business recording. External investment is regulated by the Overseas Venture Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps non-domestic shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thai Private Liability-limited Enterprise (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, statutory obligations, enrollment phases, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand Ltd. enterprise.

Advantages of a Thailand-based Ltd. Enterprise

A Thailand-based liability-limited business offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing operation in Thailand:

Limited Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – financiers risk only the capital they put into the enterprise
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the organization’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Regulatory Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its partners. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct venture in its own name without implicating stakeholders in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the business can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The enterprise’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if owners change or pass away. The enterprise can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add financiers or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support venture growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand Market Access with Non-domestic Participation: A restricted liability enterprise allows external financiers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, external backers can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thai laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered enterprise can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for external employees or executives. Thailand-based Ltd. enterprises are the typical vehicle for obtaining venture visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the organization meets certain capital and in-country employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI businesses or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal venture presence. Many Thailand-based agencies and large firms prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thai restricted liability business offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling overseas investment and complying with within Thailand ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular enterprise entity in Thailand.

Compliance Obligations for a Thai Ltd. Organization

Setting up a Thailand Co., Ltd. involves meeting several regulatory criteria, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Members: You need a minimum of 2 stakeholders (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private restricted liability organization
library.siam-lawful.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Partners can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-lawful.com
. Thai law requires at least two owners to be maintained at all times during the business’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of stakeholders for a private business, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public enterprise structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thai vs. Overseas Ownership: By default, a Ltd. enterprise can be 100% Thailand-owned or up to 49% non-domestic-owned without special permits
siam-lawful.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the firm is considered “external” under the External Enterprise Act (FBA) and may need a External Enterprise License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-statutory.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand-based nominee partners (Thai citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thai partners is required.

Executives: A Thai limited enterprise must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no statutory requirement for a Thai national to be a director – overseas board members are allowed, though in practice a non-domestic director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Board members are elected by the partners and have the authority to bind the business in transactions. The board of executives (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the business and its members
siam-regulatory.com
. The enterprise’s Articles of Association can specify how many executives constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two board members signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director firm is also very common for small businesses. Executives need not be stakeholders, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-based-owned organization – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended commercial endeavor and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the firm will employ any overseas nationals or if it will be majority international-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a enterprise needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per non-domestic work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a overseas-majority firm often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a Overseas Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-lawful.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-statutory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a firm with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the members initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-majority enterprises, but for overseas-majority enterprises they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a sign-up fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Enterprise Name: The business’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Liability-limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-lawful.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing businesses. The name may be in Thai or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand name for filing purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with recording.

Registered Address: Every firm must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where firm records are kept and regulatory notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for filing – typically a copy of the house recording deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the business
siam-regulatory.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for filing). Note that after incorporation, if the enterprise moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the enterprise. The MOA must state: (1) the approved firm name, (2) the province where the business will be located, (3) the venture objectives of the business, (4) a declaration that liability of stakeholders is liability-limited, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the organization – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-statutory.com
. The organization objectives can be broad (you can list multiple commercial endeavor activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have international partners, unless you plan to obtain a External Operation License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a organization may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the business (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of filing (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small enterprises in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with statutory advice.

Initial Stakeholders and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-compliance.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thailand-based firms (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to owners after incorporation. If any shareholder is a overseas individual or business, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate paperwork for the sign-up method.

Managers and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the executives and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the business (for example, to sign contracts or bank records). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two board members jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the enrollment application and related filings. Board members will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a lawful requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the organization must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the business’s incorporation records, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many enterprises engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the lawful prerequisites for a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 owners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital conditions especially if external involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the business enrollment step-by-step approach described next.

Step-by-Step Filing Method

Setting up a Thailand liability-limited business involves several sequential stages with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the method, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Business Name – The first step is to choose a unique firm name and reserve it with the Department of Operation Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing business names, and must end in “Liability-limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 enterprise days
siam-statutory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the firm using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Commercial endeavor Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the compliance obligations, includes the firm name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for sign-up. This can be done at the Operation Recording office in the province where the firm will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thai ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA filing is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming paperwork are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-statutory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-compliance.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial members) must be held. If there are only a few owners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the enterprise’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Executives is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the organization (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand law required publishing a notice in a local market newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few members). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-lawful.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small organizations, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (owners), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Organization (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the firm as a compliance entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for organization recording, attaching required paperwork: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of owners, details of the newly appointed executives and their signatory powers, the written consent of the firm’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house sign-up copy). The leaders will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the board members is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business recording application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA sign-up (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-regulatory.com
, otherwise the workflow lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the filing usually within 1 operation day – you will then receive the Firm Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the organization’s filing number and Levy ID, and a certified list of owners. Congratulations, at this point the business legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Tax-related ID and Register for VAT – Once the organization is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the enterprise’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its sign-up number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your enterprise expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Fiscal (VAT). The VAT enrollment is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new enterprises). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide paperwork such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the enterprise affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT filing should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting enterprise if required by nature of venture
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your enterprise fully operational:

Social Security Recording: If you will hire employees (Thailand or international), you must register your firm as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the business affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the firm seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a statutory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your commercial endeavor, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food commercial endeavor licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For international-majority businesses, if the commercial endeavor activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Overseas Enterprise License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that commercial endeavor
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s External Operation Division) and involves a separate application outlining the enterprise plan, justifications, and how the commercial endeavor will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss international commercial endeavor licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward firm can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and business filing (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Enrollment system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire procedure from MOA to firm recording can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online firm sign-up (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the procedure. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand-based language, engaging a statutory or accounting firm to assist with filing is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand-based Ltd. enterprise is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s levy laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Revenue Levy (CIT): Thai businesses are subject to corporate takings taxation on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive levy scheme for small businesses: businesses with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and takings ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate fiscal is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but businesses can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate fiscal return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, organizations must file a half-year levy return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s fiscal in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year enterprises). Any withholding taxation the enterprise has paid or that was withheld from payments to the firm can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Taxation (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the firm must register under the Value Added Levy system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the organization needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output levy collected and input tax-related paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Venture Tax-related depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding tax-related on certain payments. For example, when your organization pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand enterprise, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% levy respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your business pays dividends to members, a 10% withholding levy is applied (for Thailand residents; 10% is also the standard rate for overseas stakeholders, unless reduced by a fiscal treaty). You must file monthly withholding taxation returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for businesses) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the firm liable for the taxation plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the enterprise has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The organization needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal earnings taxation withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a organization maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand auditor (CPA)
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. Every year, the enterprise must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of partners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-compliance.com
. For example, a business on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-lawful.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual fiscal return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for executives and dissolution of the firm by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License Renewals/Reporting: If your enterprise has a Non-domestic Operation License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI firms, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the enterprise enjoys any levy incentives, ensure to comply with their conditions.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the business’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of board members, changes of enterprise address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in stakeholders. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a partners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a stakeholders’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand-based business comes with monthly compliance (levy filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand accounting standards and taxation rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thai accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand-based language (or with Thai translations). Good compliance will keep your business in good standing and avoid fines or compliance trouble.

International Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external backers is how Thailand-based law treats non-domestic ownership of businesses, and what additional obligations come into play when hiring overseas staff or having external leaders. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Overseas Shareholding Limits – The Non-domestic Operation Act: The International Enterprise Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting overseas ownership in Thailand firms
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a business is considered “international” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is international-owned (for juristic partners)
siam-lawful.com
. Non-domestic firms are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain enterprise activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand-based majority firm.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where international involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thailand-based enterprises are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. International-majority organizations cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a International Venture License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal venture activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service enterprise,” requiring a license if non-domestic-owned beyond 49%. If your firm is majority Thailand-based-owned (51% or more Thai owners), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thai entity without those restrictions
siam-compliance.com
. This is why some external financiers opt for Thai partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand-based members (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand nationals from acting as strawmen for overseas control
Thai-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of businesses under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Both the Thailand proxy and non-domestic beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thailand-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand owners in your firm are genuine financiers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% international ownership in a restricted enterprise, here are regulatory pathways:

Obtain a International Operation License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s External Commercial endeavor Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your commercial endeavor should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand-based employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many external organizations do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your venture is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved businesses can be 100% non-domestic-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic External Venture Certificate. However, BOI enterprises must meet specific project criteria and are Ltd. to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a enterprise in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-compliance.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your operation activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority firm doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned operation is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of commercial endeavor to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the commercial endeavor into a Thai entity for restricted parts and a non-domestic entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring International Staff: To legally work in Thailand, non-domestic nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thai Ltd. organization can sponsor work permits for external board members, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The business must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per international work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the external employee is married to a Thailand)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The organization must employ 4 Thailand-based full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 overseas work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand-based staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard enterprises (meaning after 40 Thai employees and 10 foreigners, the enterprise would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The firm should be fully registered and operating, with a real commercial endeavor address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new enterprises, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Tax-related ID and VAT enrollment if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Businesses with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand employee rule (BOI firms can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand-based employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The enterprise then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required filings include the firm papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience forms of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the firm they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The organization must continue to meet the Thailand-based employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a firm would hire an expat for.

For non-domestic board members who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign paperwork or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many non-domestic managers choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a operation visa.

Hiring Non-domestic Employees: When hiring a external employee (aside from leaders), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of criteria. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand-based limited organization can indeed hire foreigners and have overseas managers, but it must maintain a substantial venture presence to justify it – real capital, Thai staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have external executives living in Thailand, plan your business’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a organization in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Partners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand owners just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thai authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thailand-based partner, consider the regulatory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority non-domestic ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, commercial endeavor closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your enterprise’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing needs. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed operation should be lawful for your enterprise to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for external organizations (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-lawful.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new operation owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and statutory headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (managers, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and tax-related payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All business filing filings must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a external promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand-based embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai partners or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand-based friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Domestic Advice: Thailand-based corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated local market resources or regulatory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a non-domestic director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum owners rule changed in 2023
library.siam-statutory.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a external enterprise license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with tax-related ID numbers, etc. Small businesses sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the enterprise. Setting up a enterprise is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Regulatory References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key statutory references and resources related to Thailand-based restricted liability enterprises:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing businesses. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of limited enterprises. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a liability-limited organization as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-compliance.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-compliance.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by partners within 4 months)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific compliance question on corporate procedures.

External Enterprise Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts international ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for international financiers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for external-owned organizations. It also provides the lawful basis for International Operation Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in lawful databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring external investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thai employee obligations (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the statutory context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for business enrollment procedures. While much content is in Thailand, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online recording). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-sign-up portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a External Venture Division page which explains the International Venture License application step-by-step approach and criteria.

Thailand-based Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate takings levy rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides taxation return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for taxation compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the step-by-step approach of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease external ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of conditions (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American enterprises on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the workflow typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for filing (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer sign-up phases and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thai organization law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with regulatory references provided, to ensure accuracy

. By following the guidelines and stages outlined, and leveraging official resources, you can navigate the workflow of setting up a Thailand-based Ltd. Firm with confidence. Good luck with your commercial endeavor venture in Thailand!

Setting Up a Thai Restricted liability Organization (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Manual
Introduction

A Thai Limited Firm (Business Liability-limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common operation structure in Thailand for both within Thailand entrepreneurs and international financiers. It is a private organization form similar to a Ltd. liability organization (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate compliance entity and liability-limited liability for its owners
siam-compliance.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the organization’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is liability-limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees organization filing. External investment is regulated by the International Commercial endeavor Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps international shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this handbook, we focus solely on the Thailand-based Private Ltd. Firm (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, statutory conditions, sign-up stages, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand liability-limited business.

Advantages of a Thailand Limited Firm

A Thailand-based liability-limited business offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing enterprise in Thailand:

Ltd. Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – stakeholders risk only the capital they put into the organization
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the business’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Lawful Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its partners. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct commercial endeavor in its own name without implicating members in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the organization can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The business’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if members change or pass away. The operation can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add stakeholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New members can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support venture growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand Market Access with Overseas Participation: A restricted liability business allows international stakeholders to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-regulatory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, international financiers can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand-based laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered organization can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for non-domestic employees or executives. Thailand Ltd. businesses are the typical vehicle for obtaining enterprise visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the firm meets certain capital and local market employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI firms or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thai clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal operation presence. Many Thailand-based agencies and large firms prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thai Ltd. enterprise offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling overseas investment and complying with within Thailand ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular operation entity in Thailand.

Lawful Needs for a Thailand Ltd. Organization

Setting up a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involves meeting several statutory obligations, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key conditions include:

Partners: You need a minimum of 2 partners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private limited firm
library.siam-regulatory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Stakeholders can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-lawful.com
. Thailand law requires at least two partners to be maintained at all times during the business’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of owners for a private enterprise, but if you anticipate many stakeholders or public share offering, a public firm structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. Non-domestic Ownership: By default, a restricted liability enterprise can be 100% Thailand-based-owned or up to 49% international-owned without special permits
siam-compliance.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the business is considered “international” under the International Operation Act (FBA) and may need a Overseas Commercial endeavor License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-compliance.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thai shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thai nominee owners (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand-based partners is required.

Executives: A Thai Ltd. firm must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no compliance requirement for a Thailand national to be a director – overseas executives are allowed, though in practice a international director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Executives are elected by the stakeholders and have the authority to bind the enterprise in transactions. The board of executives (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the business and its partners
siam-lawful.com
. The firm’s Articles of Association can specify how many executives constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two board members signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director firm is also very common for small businesses. Managers need not be partners, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-owned firm – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended commercial endeavor and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the organization will employ any international nationals or if it will be majority overseas-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a business needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per non-domestic work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a external-majority business often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a International Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-regulatory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-statutory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a organization with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the owners initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-majority enterprises, but for international-majority organizations they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a recording fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Enterprise Name: The enterprise’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Restricted liability” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing businesses. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand-based name for filing purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with recording.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where enterprise records are kept and compliance notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for filing – typically a copy of the house recording deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the enterprise
siam-compliance.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for sign-up). Note that after incorporation, if the organization moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the firm. The MOA must state: (1) the approved enterprise name, (2) the province where the business will be located, (3) the venture objectives of the organization, (4) a declaration that liability of members is Ltd., (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the enterprise – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-regulatory.com
. The enterprise objectives can be broad (you can list multiple commercial endeavor activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have external owners, unless you plan to obtain a Non-domestic Operation License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a business may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the organization (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of sign-up (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small businesses in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Members and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-compliance.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai firms (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to stakeholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a international individual or business, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate forms for the enrollment workflow.

Board members and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the managers and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the firm (for example, to sign contracts or bank paperwork). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two executives jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the filing application and related filings. Leaders will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a statutory requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the business must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the enterprise’s incorporation paperwork, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by members and authorities. Many firms engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the statutory prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 members, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational paperwork (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital criteria especially if international involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the enterprise sign-up step-by-step approach described next.

Step-by-Step Recording Step-by-step approach

Setting up a Thai limited enterprise involves several sequential checkpoints with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Business Name – The first step is to choose a unique enterprise name and reserve it with the Department of Enterprise Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing business names, and must end in “Ltd.”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 venture days
siam-statutory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the business using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Venture Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the regulatory criteria, includes the enterprise name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for sign-up. This can be done at the Venture Enrollment office in the province where the firm will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA sign-up is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming records are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial owners) must be held. If there are only a few stakeholders, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the firm’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Board members is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the business (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand law required publishing a notice in a local market newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few owners). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small businesses, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (stakeholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Business (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the business as a lawful entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for organization enrollment, attaching required forms: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of members, details of the newly appointed executives and their signatory powers, the written consent of the organization’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house recording copy). The executives will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the leaders is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business recording application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA recording (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-compliance.com
, otherwise the workflow lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the recording usually within 1 enterprise day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the business’s filing number and Levy ID, and a certified list of stakeholders. Congratulations, at this point the organization legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Taxation ID and Register for VAT – Once the enterprise is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the organization’s Taxation ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your enterprise expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Fiscal (VAT). The VAT recording is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new organizations). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide paperwork such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the business affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT enrollment should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting venture if required by nature of operation
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your business fully operational:

Social Security Filing: If you will hire employees (Thailand or international), you must register your enterprise as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the firm affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the enterprise seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a regulatory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your venture, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food commercial endeavor licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For international-majority organizations, if the operation activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Overseas Enterprise License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that commercial endeavor
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Division) and involves a separate application outlining the enterprise plan, justifications, and how the commercial endeavor will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss international operation licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward enterprise can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and firm enrollment (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Sign-up system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire method from MOA to enterprise filing can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online business recording (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the workflow. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand language, engaging a regulatory or accounting firm to assist with enrollment is common and can ensure all forms are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand restricted liability enterprise is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s tax-related laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Takings Fiscal (CIT): Thailand-based organizations are subject to corporate turnover taxation on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax-related scheme for small businesses: organizations with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and takings ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but firms can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate fiscal return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, organizations must file a half-year fiscal return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s tax-related in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year organizations). Any withholding levy the business has paid or that was withheld from payments to the business can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Taxation (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the firm must register under the Value Added Fiscal system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the business needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output levy collected and input tax-related paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Commercial endeavor Levy depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding taxation on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thai organization, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% levy respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your enterprise pays dividends to members, a 10% withholding taxation is applied (for Thai residents; 10% is also the standard rate for international owners, unless reduced by a fiscal treaty). You must file monthly withholding fiscal returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for firms) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the firm liable for the levy plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the enterprise has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The enterprise needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal revenue tax-related withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a firm maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand auditor (CPA)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. Every year, the organization must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of stakeholders within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-statutory.com
. For example, a organization on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-lawful.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual taxation return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for managers and dissolution of the enterprise by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

External Venture License Renewals/Reporting: If your enterprise has a External Operation License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI firms, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the enterprise enjoys any taxation incentives, ensure to comply with their needs.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the enterprise’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of managers, changes of business address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in partners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a stakeholders’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a members’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand-based enterprise comes with monthly compliance (fiscal filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand accounting standards and taxation rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand-based accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thai language (or with Thailand translations). Good compliance will keep your business in good standing and avoid fines or lawful trouble.

International Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external shareholders is how Thailand law treats non-domestic ownership of businesses, and what additional obligations come into play when hiring external staff or having non-domestic executives. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Non-domestic Shareholding Limits – The Overseas Operation Act: The External Venture Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting overseas ownership in Thailand enterprises
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a business is considered “overseas” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is overseas-owned (for juristic stakeholders)
siam-lawful.com
. Non-domestic businesses are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain commercial endeavor activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thai majority organization.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where non-domestic involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thailand businesses are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. External-majority firms cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Non-domestic Enterprise License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal commercial endeavor activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service commercial endeavor,” requiring a license if international-owned beyond 49%. If your firm is majority Thailand-based-owned (51% or more Thailand stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand-based entity without those restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. This is why some external stakeholders opt for Thailand partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand owners (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thai nationals from acting as strawmen for non-domestic control
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of organizations under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Both the Thailand proxy and overseas beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thai stakeholders in your enterprise are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% international ownership in a restricted operation, here are lawful pathways:

Obtain a International Venture License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your enterprise should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many non-domestic organizations do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your operation is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved organizations can be 100% non-domestic-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic External Enterprise Certificate. However, BOI businesses must meet specific project criteria and are limited to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a organization in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-compliance.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your venture activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thailand majority business doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned commercial endeavor is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of commercial endeavor to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the enterprise into a Thailand entity for restricted parts and a international entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring External Staff: To legally work in Thailand, overseas nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand-based liability-limited enterprise can sponsor work permits for non-domestic board members, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The organization must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per non-domestic work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the international employee is married to a Thai)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The organization must employ 4 Thailand-based full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 overseas work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per firm for standard firms (meaning after 40 Thailand employees and 10 foreigners, the enterprise would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The firm should be fully registered and operating, with a real operation address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new organizations, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Taxation ID and VAT enrollment if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Businesses with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thai employee rule (BOI organizations can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The business then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required records include the organization papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience records of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the firm they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The enterprise must continue to meet the Thai employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a organization would hire an expat for.

For international board members who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign forms or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many non-domestic leaders choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a commercial endeavor visa.

Hiring International Employees: When hiring a international employee (aside from managers), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of needs. The organization must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand Ltd. firm can indeed hire foreigners and have overseas managers, but it must maintain a substantial venture presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand-based staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have overseas executives living in Thailand, plan your organization’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a organization in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Partners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand-based stakeholders just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the statutory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority overseas ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, operation closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your organization’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing criteria. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed commercial endeavor should be lawful for your business to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for overseas firms (they expect at least THB 2–3M for non-domestic-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-regulatory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new venture owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and lawful headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (leaders, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and tax-related payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All enterprise sign-up records must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a external promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thai embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because paperwork are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thai law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai owners or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand-based friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Within thailand Advice: Thai corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated within Thailand resources or regulatory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a international director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum stakeholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-compliance.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a external enterprise license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with fiscal ID numbers, etc. Small organizations sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the operation. Setting up a enterprise is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Statutory References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key statutory references and resources related to Thai restricted liability organizations:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing enterprises. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of restricted liability firms. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a liability-limited firm as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by partners within 4 months)
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific lawful question on corporate procedures.

Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts non-domestic ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for international shareholders to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned businesses. It also provides the regulatory basis for International Enterprise Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in statutory databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thai citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring external investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand-based employee criteria (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the regulatory context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for firm recording procedures. While much content is in Thailand-based, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online filing). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-sign-up portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Non-domestic Operation Division page which explains the International Commercial endeavor License application procedure and obligations.

Thailand Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate takings levy rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides fiscal return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for levy compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the procedure of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease overseas ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of obligations (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American businesses on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand-based Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for filing (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer recording milestones and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand enterprise law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with lawful references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thailand-based Restricted liability Enterprise (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Manual
Introduction

A Thai Limited Enterprise (Organization Limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common commercial endeavor structure in Thailand for both domestic entrepreneurs and external shareholders. It is a private organization form similar to a Ltd. liability business (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate lawful entity and liability-limited liability for its owners
siam-statutory.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the business’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-compliance.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Venture Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees enterprise sign-up. Overseas investment is regulated by the External Venture Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps non-domestic shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thailand-based Private Restricted liability Enterprise (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, statutory criteria, enrollment checkpoints, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant statutory references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand-based Ltd. business.

Advantages of a Thai Liability-limited Organization

A Thailand limited firm offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing venture in Thailand:

Liability-limited Liability: Owners have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – stakeholders risk only the capital they put into the firm
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the firm’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Lawful Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its partners. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct venture in its own name without implicating stakeholders in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the business can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The organization’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if partners change or pass away. The enterprise can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add shareholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support operation growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thai Market Access with International Participation: A limited enterprise allows overseas stakeholders to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-statutory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-compliance.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, overseas shareholders can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered firm can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for non-domestic employees or executives. Thailand limited enterprises are the typical vehicle for obtaining venture visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the enterprise meets certain capital and within Thailand employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI businesses or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand-based clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal operation presence. Many Thailand agencies and large firms prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand-based restricted liability firm offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling external investment and complying with domestic ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular operation entity in Thailand.

Lawful Needs for a Thailand-based Restricted liability Firm

Setting up a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involves meeting several regulatory obligations, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key obligations include:

Partners: You need a minimum of 2 stakeholders (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private Ltd. organization
library.siam-regulatory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Partners can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-compliance.com
. Thailand law requires at least two owners to be maintained at all times during the firm’s existence – if the number falls below two, the organization may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of members for a private enterprise, but if you anticipate many owners or public share offering, a public enterprise structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thai vs. Non-domestic Ownership: By default, a limited firm can be 100% Thai-owned or up to 49% non-domestic-owned without special permits
siam-lawful.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the firm is considered “overseas” under the International Venture Act (FBA) and may need a International Enterprise License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-lawful.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand-based shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand nominee partners (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thailand-based-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thai partners is required.

Executives: A Thailand restricted liability business must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no regulatory requirement for a Thailand national to be a director – international board members are allowed, though in practice a external director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Executives are elected by the owners and have the authority to bind the organization in transactions. The board of managers (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the enterprise and its stakeholders
siam-regulatory.com
. The firm’s Articles of Association can specify how many board members constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two leaders signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director business is also very common for small businesses. Managers need not be partners, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thai-owned business – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended venture and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the business will employ any overseas nationals or if it will be majority external-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a organization needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per external work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thai national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a overseas-majority organization often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a Non-domestic Venture License for restricted activities
siam-statutory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-compliance.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a firm with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the members initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thai-majority businesses, but for overseas-majority firms they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a enrollment fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Organization Name: The organization’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-compliance.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing firms. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thai name for filing purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with sign-up.

Registered Address: Every enterprise must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where organization records are kept and lawful notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for enrollment – typically a copy of the house enrollment deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the firm
siam-compliance.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for filing). Note that after incorporation, if the firm moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the firm. The MOA must state: (1) the approved business name, (2) the province where the firm will be located, (3) the operation objectives of the firm, (4) a declaration that liability of partners is limited, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the organization – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-statutory.com
. The firm objectives can be broad (you can list multiple commercial endeavor activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have international members, unless you plan to obtain a International Enterprise License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a organization may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the business (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of filing (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small organizations in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Partners and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-regulatory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thailand businesses (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to stakeholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a overseas individual or business, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate records for the enrollment procedure.

Board members and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the board members and authorized signatories. Authorized board members are those who can sign on behalf of the firm (for example, to sign contracts or bank filings). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two board members jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the enrollment application and related filings. Executives will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a lawful requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the enterprise must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the firm’s incorporation records, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many enterprises engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the lawful prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 stakeholders, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital obligations especially if international involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the organization enrollment step-by-step approach described next.

Step-by-Step Filing Step-by-step approach

Setting up a Thailand liability-limited firm involves several sequential milestones with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Enterprise Name – The first step is to choose a unique firm name and reserve it with the Department of Operation Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing enterprise names, and must end in “Ltd.”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 venture days
siam-regulatory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the firm using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Venture Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the regulatory needs, includes the business name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for filing. This can be done at the Commercial endeavor Filing office in the province where the enterprise will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand-based ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA filing is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming records are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-statutory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial members) must be held. If there are only a few stakeholders, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the organization’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Executives is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the organization (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand-based law required publishing a notice in a local market newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few members). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-compliance.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small firms, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (members), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Firm (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the business as a regulatory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for firm sign-up, attaching required records: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of members, details of the newly appointed managers and their signatory powers, the written consent of the firm’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house recording copy). The executives will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the executives is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business recording application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA enrollment (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-statutory.com
, otherwise the method lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the filing usually within 1 operation day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the firm’s filing number and Taxation ID, and a certified list of members. Congratulations, at this point the business legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Taxation ID and Register for VAT – Once the business is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the firm’s Fiscal ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your firm expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Levy (VAT). The VAT recording is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new businesses). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide paperwork such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the organization affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT filing should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting enterprise if required by nature of operation
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main recording, there are a few additional tasks to get your enterprise fully operational:

Social Security Recording: If you will hire employees (Thai or non-domestic), you must register your organization as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the business affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the business seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a lawful requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your venture, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food commercial endeavor licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For international-majority enterprises, if the enterprise activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a External Venture License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that commercial endeavor
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Non-domestic Operation Division) and involves a separate application outlining the enterprise plan, justifications, and how the enterprise will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas operation licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward enterprise can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and business recording (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Enrollment system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire step-by-step approach from MOA to firm sign-up can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online firm filing (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the workflow. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand-based language, engaging a lawful or accounting firm to assist with sign-up is common and can ensure all forms are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thai liability-limited organization is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s taxation laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Revenue Fiscal (CIT): Thailand-based enterprises are subject to corporate revenue fiscal on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax-related scheme for small businesses: organizations with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and turnover ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but firms can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate levy return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, firms must file a half-year fiscal return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s fiscal in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year businesses). Any withholding tax-related the business has paid or that was withheld from payments to the firm can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Fiscal (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the business must register under the Value Added Levy system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the firm needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output taxation collected and input levy paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Commercial endeavor Fiscal depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding levy on certain payments. For example, when your enterprise pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand-based organization, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% taxation respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your firm pays dividends to stakeholders, a 10% withholding levy is applied (for Thailand-based residents; 10% is also the standard rate for external partners, unless reduced by a fiscal treaty). You must file monthly withholding levy returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for businesses) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the business liable for the tax-related plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the business has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The organization needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal revenue tax-related withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a enterprise maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand-based auditor (CPA)
library.siam-compliance.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. Every year, the firm must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of stakeholders within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, a enterprise on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual fiscal return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for board members and dissolution of the business by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

International Enterprise License Renewals/Reporting: If your enterprise has a International Operation License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI firms, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the business enjoys any tax-related incentives, ensure to comply with their obligations.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the enterprise’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of leaders, changes of enterprise address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a partners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a owners’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand organization comes with monthly compliance (fiscal filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand-based accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand-based accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand language (or with Thai translations). Good compliance will keep your firm in good standing and avoid fines or lawful trouble.

Overseas Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for international backers is how Thai law treats international ownership of enterprises, and what additional needs come into play when hiring non-domestic staff or having non-domestic board members. Below, we address international shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

External Shareholding Limits – The External Operation Act: The International Operation Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting overseas ownership in Thailand organizations
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a enterprise is considered “overseas” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is non-domestic-owned (for juristic stakeholders)
siam-statutory.com
. Overseas enterprises are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain commercial endeavor activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand-based majority enterprise.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where non-domestic involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general financiers.

List 3: Activities where Thailand organizations are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. International-majority firms cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Non-domestic Operation License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal enterprise activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service commercial endeavor,” requiring a license if non-domestic-owned beyond 49%. If your organization is majority Thailand-based-owned (51% or more Thai stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand entity without those restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. This is why some international backers opt for Thailand partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand members (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the enterprise is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand-based nationals from acting as strawmen for international control
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of firms under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. Both the Thai proxy and external beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand partners in your business are genuine stakeholders with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% international ownership in a restricted venture, here are statutory pathways:

Obtain a Overseas Enterprise License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s International Enterprise Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your commercial endeavor should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many overseas firms do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your commercial endeavor is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved businesses can be 100% external-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like levy holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic Overseas Commercial endeavor Certificate. However, BOI organizations must meet specific project criteria and are restricted liability to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a enterprise in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-compliance.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your enterprise activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority firm doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned enterprise is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of commercial endeavor to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the venture into a Thailand-based entity for restricted parts and a overseas entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring Overseas Staff: To legally work in Thailand, external nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand Ltd. organization can sponsor work permits for international board members, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The enterprise must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per external work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the international employee is married to a Thailand)
airswift.com
. This is why many enterprises that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The business must employ 4 Thailand-based full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 international work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard enterprises (meaning after 40 Thailand-based employees and 10 foreigners, the business would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The business should be fully registered and operating, with a real commercial endeavor address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new enterprises, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Fiscal ID and VAT filing if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Firms with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand-based employee rule (BOI enterprises can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thai, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The enterprise then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required filings include the firm papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience forms of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the firm they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The organization must continue to meet the Thai employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a organization would hire an expat for.

For non-domestic executives who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign forms or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many international managers choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a operation visa.

Hiring International Employees: When hiring a international employee (aside from board members), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of obligations. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thai Ltd. enterprise can indeed hire foreigners and have international managers, but it must maintain a substantial enterprise presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have overseas managers living in Thailand, plan your firm’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a firm in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Partners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thai members just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the lawful routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority overseas ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, enterprise closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your business’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing needs. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed commercial endeavor should be lawful for your organization to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for overseas organizations (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-regulatory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new commercial endeavor owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and lawful headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (managers, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and taxation payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All organization sign-up forms must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a external promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thai embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because paperwork are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand law.

Mismanaging Thailand-based Partner Relationships: If you do have Thailand-based members or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thai friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Local market Advice: Thailand-based corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated domestic resources or statutory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a international director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum partners rule changed in 2023
library.siam-regulatory.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a external commercial endeavor license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with levy ID numbers, etc. Small organizations sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the venture. Setting up a organization is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Regulatory References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key regulatory references and resources related to Thai restricted liability firms:

Thailand-based Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing businesses. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of restricted liability businesses. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a Ltd. firm as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability limited to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-lawful.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-lawful.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by owners within 4 months)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific lawful question on corporate procedures.

External Commercial endeavor Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts external ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for international financiers to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned enterprises. It also provides the statutory basis for Overseas Operation Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in compliance databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including non-domestic-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring international investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand employee conditions (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the statutory context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Venture Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for business filing procedures. While much content is in Thailand, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online sign-up). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-recording portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Overseas Operation Division page which explains the Non-domestic Venture License application workflow and obligations.

Thai Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate revenue tax-related rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides taxation return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for tax-related compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the procedure of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease international ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of criteria (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American enterprises on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for enrollment (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer filing phases and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand business law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with statutory references provided, to ensure accuracy

Setting Up a Thailand Limited Organization (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Roadmap
Introduction

A Thailand Limited Business (Organization Ltd. or Co., Ltd.) is the most common commercial endeavor structure in Thailand for both local market entrepreneurs and international financiers. It is a private enterprise form similar to a limited liability business (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate regulatory entity and limited liability for its owners
siam-compliance.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the enterprise’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is Ltd. to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-compliance.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand-based Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees organization sign-up. Non-domestic investment is regulated by the Non-domestic Operation Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps external shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thailand-based Private Ltd. Firm (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, statutory criteria, sign-up phases, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant regulatory references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand restricted liability business.

Advantages of a Thailand-based Ltd. Organization

A Thailand-based limited enterprise offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing operation in Thailand:

Liability-limited Liability: Stakeholders have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – shareholders risk only the capital they put into the firm
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the firm’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Compliance Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its members. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct venture in its own name without implicating partners in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the business can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The organization’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if members change or pass away. The operation can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add backers or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support enterprise growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thai Market Access with Overseas Participation: A restricted liability organization allows external financiers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-lawful.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, overseas shareholders can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thai laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered enterprise can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for external employees or executives. Thailand-based liability-limited businesses are the typical vehicle for obtaining operation visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the organization meets certain capital and in-country employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI enterprises or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thailand-based clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal operation presence. Many Thai agencies and large firms prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand-based restricted liability business offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling international investment and complying with in-country ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular enterprise entity in Thailand.

Compliance Criteria for a Thailand-based Ltd. Business

Setting up a Thailand Co., Ltd. involves meeting several regulatory needs, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Partners: You need a minimum of 2 owners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private Ltd. organization
library.siam-compliance.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Stakeholders can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Thailand law requires at least two stakeholders to be maintained at all times during the organization’s existence – if the number falls below two, the business may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of stakeholders for a private firm, but if you anticipate many stakeholders or public share offering, a public firm structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thai vs. External Ownership: By default, a limited firm can be 100% Thailand-based-owned or up to 49% international-owned without special permits
siam-lawful.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the firm is considered “external” under the External Operation Act (FBA) and may need a External Enterprise License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-compliance.com
. We will discuss non-domestic ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand-based nominee stakeholders (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thailand-based-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand partners is required.

Managers: A Thailand liability-limited enterprise must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no lawful requirement for a Thailand national to be a director – external board members are allowed, though in practice a international director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Leaders are elected by the stakeholders and have the authority to bind the business in transactions. The board of leaders (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the firm and its partners
siam-statutory.com
. The enterprise’s Articles of Association can specify how many managers constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two executives signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director business is also very common for small businesses. Leaders need not be stakeholders, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thai-owned enterprise – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended operation and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the firm will employ any overseas nationals or if it will be majority external-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a business needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per international work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a non-domestic-majority organization often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a External Enterprise License for restricted activities
siam-lawful.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a firm with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the partners initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thai-majority organizations, but for external-majority organizations they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a sign-up fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Firm Name: The organization’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-statutory.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing enterprises. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand-based name for filing purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with sign-up.

Registered Address: Every enterprise must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where organization records are kept and regulatory notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for filing – typically a copy of the house recording deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the organization
siam-compliance.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for recording). Note that after incorporation, if the enterprise moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the enterprise. The MOA must state: (1) the approved organization name, (2) the province where the organization will be located, (3) the enterprise objectives of the organization, (4) a declaration that liability of partners is restricted liability, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-compliance.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the organization – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-statutory.com
. The enterprise objectives can be broad (you can list multiple venture activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have non-domestic members, unless you plan to obtain a International Enterprise License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a enterprise may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the enterprise (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of sign-up (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small businesses in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Members and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-statutory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thailand firms (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to owners after incorporation. If any shareholder is a international individual or organization, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate records for the filing procedure.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the managers and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the business (for example, to sign contracts or bank filings). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two board members jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the enrollment application and related filings. Board members will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a regulatory requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the organization must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the enterprise’s incorporation records, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by owners and authorities. Many firms engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the regulatory prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 partners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital obligations especially if external involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the organization recording procedure described next.

Step-by-Step Sign-up Method

Setting up a Thailand Ltd. organization involves several sequential checkpoints with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Enterprise Name – The first step is to choose a unique organization name and reserve it with the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing organization names, and must end in “Ltd.”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 operation days
siam-statutory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the organization using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Operation Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the statutory criteria, includes the business name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for filing. This can be done at the Commercial endeavor Filing office in the province where the firm will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA enrollment is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming records are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-lawful.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial partners) must be held. If there are only a few owners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the firm’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Leaders is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the business (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand-based law required publishing a notice in a domestic newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few stakeholders). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-compliance.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small firms, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (members), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Business (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the organization as a lawful entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for business filing, attaching required forms: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of members, details of the newly appointed board members and their signatory powers, the written consent of the business’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house sign-up copy). The executives will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the managers is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The organization enrollment application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA filing (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-statutory.com
, otherwise the workflow lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the enrollment usually within 1 enterprise day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the enterprise’s enrollment number and Fiscal ID, and a certified list of stakeholders. Congratulations, at this point the business legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Fiscal ID and Register for VAT – Once the firm is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the business’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its sign-up number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your firm expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Tax-related (VAT). The VAT enrollment is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new organizations). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide records such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the enterprise affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT recording should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting venture if required by nature of operation
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main enrollment, there are a few additional tasks to get your firm fully operational:

Social Security Filing: If you will hire employees (Thai or international), you must register your organization as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the enterprise affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the business seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a statutory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your commercial endeavor, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food commercial endeavor licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For external-majority businesses, if the venture activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Overseas Operation License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that commercial endeavor
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Overseas Operation Division) and involves a separate application outlining the operation plan, justifications, and how the enterprise will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss external venture licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward business can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and firm enrollment (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Enrollment system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like taxation and VAT. By law, the entire workflow from MOA to firm filing can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online firm enrollment (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the method. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand language, engaging a lawful or accounting firm to assist with filing is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand liability-limited firm is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s tax-related laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Turnover Tax-related (CIT): Thailand-based businesses are subject to corporate revenue tax-related on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax-related scheme for small businesses: organizations with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and takings ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate taxation is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but businesses can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate fiscal return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, enterprises must file a half-year levy return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s taxation in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year organizations). Any withholding taxation the business has paid or that was withheld from payments to the enterprise can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Taxation (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the enterprise must register under the Value Added Levy system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the firm needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output taxation collected and input fiscal paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Commercial endeavor Taxation depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding fiscal on certain payments. For example, when your organization pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand business, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% taxation respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your firm pays dividends to partners, a 10% withholding levy is applied (for Thailand residents; 10% is also the standard rate for international owners, unless reduced by a levy treaty). You must file monthly withholding fiscal returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for organizations) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the business liable for the taxation plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the enterprise has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The firm needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal turnover fiscal withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thailand-based law requires that a organization maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thai auditor (CPA)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. Every year, the organization must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of owners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-compliance.com
. For example, a business on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual tax-related return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for managers and dissolution of the firm by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

External Enterprise License Renewals/Reporting: If your business has a External Commercial endeavor License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI businesses, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the organization enjoys any fiscal incentives, ensure to comply with their needs.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the business’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of leaders, changes of enterprise address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a partners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a stakeholders’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thai enterprise comes with monthly compliance (taxation filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand-based accounting standards and taxation rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand language (or with Thai translations). Good compliance will keep your business in good standing and avoid fines or statutory trouble.

International Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for non-domestic financiers is how Thai law treats external ownership of firms, and what additional obligations come into play when hiring international staff or having non-domestic executives. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Non-domestic Shareholding Limits – The Overseas Operation Act: The External Operation Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting overseas ownership in Thailand businesses
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a organization is considered “overseas” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is external-owned (for juristic stakeholders)
siam-lawful.com
. International businesses are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain operation activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thai majority organization.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where external involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general backers.

List 3: Activities where Thai firms are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. External-majority businesses cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Overseas Commercial endeavor License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal enterprise activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service operation,” requiring a license if overseas-owned beyond 49%. If your enterprise is majority Thailand-based-owned (51% or more Thailand members), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thai entity without those restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. This is why some external financiers opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand-based partners (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the commercial endeavor is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand nationals from acting as strawmen for non-domestic control
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of firms under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Both the Thailand-based proxy and external beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thai stakeholders in your organization are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% international ownership in a restricted enterprise, here are lawful pathways:

Obtain a International Enterprise License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s International Venture Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your commercial endeavor should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many external firms do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your enterprise is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved firms can be 100% external-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like tax-related holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic Overseas Enterprise Certificate. However, BOI firms must meet specific project criteria and are Ltd. to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand-based Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a organization in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-regulatory.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your enterprise activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority business doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned enterprise is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of enterprise to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the enterprise into a Thailand-based entity for restricted parts and a non-domestic entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring External Staff: To legally work in Thailand, international nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand restricted liability organization can sponsor work permits for non-domestic managers, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The business must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per overseas work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the non-domestic employee is married to a Thailand)
airswift.com
. This is why many businesses that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The firm must employ 4 Thailand full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 international work permit, you need 4 Thai staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thai staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard enterprises (meaning after 40 Thai employees and 10 foreigners, the business would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The firm should be fully registered and operating, with a real operation address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new organizations, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Fiscal ID and VAT enrollment if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Businesses with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thai employee rule (BOI firms can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thai, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The organization then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required forms include the enterprise papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience paperwork of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the enterprise they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The firm must continue to meet the Thai employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a enterprise would hire an expat for.

For international managers who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign records or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many international executives choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a commercial endeavor visa.

Hiring Non-domestic Employees: When hiring a non-domestic employee (aside from executives), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of conditions. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand-based limited firm can indeed hire foreigners and have external managers, but it must maintain a substantial commercial endeavor presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand-based staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have external executives living in Thailand, plan your enterprise’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the international individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a business in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Owners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand members just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand-based authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thai-co.com
Thai-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thailand partner, consider the compliance routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority international ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, operation closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your business’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing needs. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed commercial endeavor should be lawful for your organization to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for international organizations (they expect at least THB 2–3M for overseas-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-lawful.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new venture owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and compliance headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (board members, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and fiscal payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All organization enrollment paperwork must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a overseas promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thai law.

Mismanaging Thailand-based Partner Relationships: If you do have Thailand-based owners or executives, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thai partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Within thailand Advice: Thailand-based corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated local market resources or lawful advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a non-domestic director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum stakeholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a overseas venture license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with levy ID numbers, etc. Small businesses sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the venture. Setting up a organization is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Statutory References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key lawful references and resources related to Thailand restricted liability enterprises:

Thailand-based Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing businesses. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of Ltd. businesses. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a Ltd. organization as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-compliance.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by owners within 4 months)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific statutory question on corporate procedures.

Non-domestic Operation Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts non-domestic ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for non-domestic stakeholders to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for non-domestic-owned businesses. It also provides the regulatory basis for Overseas Venture Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in statutory databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including external-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring international investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thai employee criteria (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the compliance context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for organization filing procedures. While much content is in Thai, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online sign-up). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-enrollment portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Non-domestic Operation Division page which explains the International Enterprise License application procedure and obligations.

Thai Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate turnover tax-related rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides fiscal return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for fiscal compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the step-by-step approach of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease overseas ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of needs (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American enterprises on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand-based Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the procedure typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for recording (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer recording milestones and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand firm law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with regulatory references provided, to ensure accuracy
