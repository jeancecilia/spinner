Setting Up a Thailand Restricted liability Enterprise (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Handbook
Introduction

A Thailand-based Liability-limited Firm (Business Limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common commercial endeavor structure in Thailand for both within Thailand entrepreneurs and overseas financiers. It is a private firm form similar to a liability-limited liability firm (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate lawful entity and Ltd. liability for its owners
siam-regulatory.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the organization’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is liability-limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thai Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Enterprise Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees business sign-up. International investment is regulated by the International Operation Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps overseas shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this manual, we focus solely on the Thai Private Restricted liability Enterprise (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, lawful criteria, sign-up phases, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand-based limited enterprise.

Advantages of a Thailand-based Liability-limited Business

A Thailand-based limited enterprise offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing commercial endeavor in Thailand:

Limited Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – backers risk only the capital they put into the enterprise
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the enterprise’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Regulatory Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its stakeholders. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct commercial endeavor in its own name without implicating owners in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the organization can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The organization’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if owners change or pass away. The venture can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add stakeholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New partners can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support commercial endeavor growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand-based Market Access with International Participation: A Ltd. enterprise allows external backers to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-compliance.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-lawful.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, overseas backers can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thai laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered organization can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for non-domestic employees or executives. Thailand restricted liability enterprises are the typical vehicle for obtaining enterprise visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the firm meets certain capital and in-country employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI enterprises or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thai clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal enterprise presence. Many Thai agencies and large businesses prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thailand-based restricted liability business offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling non-domestic investment and complying with in-country ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular venture entity in Thailand.

Regulatory Conditions for a Thailand-based Liability-limited Firm

Setting up a Thailand Co., Ltd. involves meeting several lawful conditions, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key needs include:

Owners: You need a minimum of 2 partners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private limited organization
library.siam-statutory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Members can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Thailand-based law requires at least two stakeholders to be maintained at all times during the business’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of partners for a private organization, but if you anticipate many members or public share offering, a public business structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thai vs. Overseas Ownership: By default, a Ltd. firm can be 100% Thai-owned or up to 49% external-owned without special permits
siam-regulatory.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the business is considered “international” under the External Commercial endeavor Act (FBA) and may need a Overseas Enterprise License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-lawful.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thailand-based shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thailand nominee members (Thailand-based citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thailand-based-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand-based partners is required.

Executives: A Thailand-based liability-limited firm must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the organization
benoit-partners.com
. There is no lawful requirement for a Thailand national to be a director – external leaders are allowed, though in practice a overseas director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Board members are elected by the stakeholders and have the authority to bind the enterprise in transactions. The board of leaders (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the firm and its members
siam-statutory.com
. The enterprise’s Articles of Association can specify how many leaders constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two leaders signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director organization is also very common for small businesses. Leaders need not be members, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-based-owned business – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended venture and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the organization will employ any non-domestic nationals or if it will be majority non-domestic-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a enterprise needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per external work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a non-domestic-majority enterprise often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-compliance.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-lawful.com
. For example, if you register a organization with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the members initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-based-majority businesses, but for overseas-majority businesses they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a recording fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Organization Name: The enterprise’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-compliance.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing organizations. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand name for recording purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with enrollment.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where business records are kept and compliance notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for sign-up – typically a copy of the house sign-up deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the business
siam-statutory.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for filing). Note that after incorporation, if the business moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the business. The MOA must state: (1) the approved firm name, (2) the province where the business will be located, (3) the venture objectives of the enterprise, (4) a declaration that liability of owners is Ltd., (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the organization – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-compliance.com
. The enterprise objectives can be broad (you can list multiple enterprise activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have international owners, unless you plan to obtain a Overseas Commercial endeavor License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a firm may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the enterprise (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of filing (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small enterprises in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with compliance advice.

Initial Partners and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-regulatory.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai enterprises (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to partners after incorporation. If any shareholder is a non-domestic individual or enterprise, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate filings for the recording workflow.

Executives and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the executives and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the organization (for example, to sign contracts or bank records). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two managers jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the filing application and related filings. Executives will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a lawful requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the business must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the firm’s incorporation filings, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by partners and authorities. Many organizations engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the statutory prerequisites for a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 owners, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational filings (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital needs especially if external involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the organization sign-up method described next.

Step-by-Step Recording Method

Setting up a Thailand Ltd. organization involves several sequential phases with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the step-by-step approach, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Enterprise Name – The first step is to choose a unique organization name and reserve it with the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing organization names, and must end in “Limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 commercial endeavor days
siam-regulatory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the organization using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Commercial endeavor Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the lawful needs, includes the firm name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for enrollment. This can be done at the Enterprise Sign-up office in the province where the enterprise will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thai ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA sign-up is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming forms are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-statutory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-compliance.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial members) must be held. If there are only a few owners, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the organization’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Board members is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the business (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand-based law required publishing a notice in a in-country newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few owners). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small enterprises, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (stakeholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Organization (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the firm as a statutory entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for business recording, attaching required filings: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of members, details of the newly appointed leaders and their signatory powers, the written consent of the firm’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house filing copy). The leaders will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the leaders is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business enrollment application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA enrollment (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-regulatory.com
, otherwise the method lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the enrollment usually within 1 operation day – you will then receive the Firm Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the organization’s filing number and Tax-related ID, and a certified list of stakeholders. Congratulations, at this point the organization legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Tax-related ID and Register for VAT – Once the business is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the enterprise’s Tax-related ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your enterprise expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Taxation (VAT). The VAT filing is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new enterprises). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide forms such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the enterprise affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT sign-up should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting operation if required by nature of enterprise
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your enterprise fully operational:

Social Security Sign-up: If you will hire employees (Thailand-based or international), you must register your firm as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the business affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the enterprise seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a statutory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your venture, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food venture licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For non-domestic-majority organizations, if the venture activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a External Enterprise License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that venture
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s International Venture Division) and involves a separate application outlining the operation plan, justifications, and how the venture will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss overseas commercial endeavor licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward organization can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and business sign-up (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Sign-up system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like tax-related and VAT. By law, the entire workflow from MOA to firm sign-up can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online firm enrollment (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the method. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand language, engaging a statutory or accounting firm to assist with recording is common and can ensure all paperwork are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand limited organization is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s levy laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Revenue Tax-related (CIT): Thai enterprises are subject to corporate turnover tax-related on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive fiscal scheme for small businesses: enterprises with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and revenue ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but enterprises can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate levy return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, enterprises must file a half-year levy return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s fiscal in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year firms). Any withholding levy the enterprise has paid or that was withheld from payments to the enterprise can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Levy (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the business must register under the Value Added Fiscal system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the organization needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output tax-related collected and input levy paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Operation Taxation depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding fiscal on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thailand firm, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% taxation respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your firm pays dividends to stakeholders, a 10% withholding levy is applied (for Thailand-based residents; 10% is also the standard rate for external stakeholders, unless reduced by a fiscal treaty). You must file monthly withholding taxation returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for firms) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the organization liable for the taxation plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the business has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The organization needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal earnings taxation withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a organization maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thai auditor (CPA)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. Every year, the enterprise must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of owners within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, a enterprise on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual tax-related return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for executives and dissolution of the business by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Non-domestic Commercial endeavor License Renewals/Reporting: If your organization has a Non-domestic Venture License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI businesses, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the business enjoys any tax-related incentives, ensure to comply with their obligations.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the firm’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of board members, changes of firm address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in owners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a owners’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a owners’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thai organization comes with monthly compliance (tax-related filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand accounting standards and fiscal rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thai accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thailand-based language (or with Thailand-based translations). Good compliance will keep your enterprise in good standing and avoid fines or compliance trouble.

Non-domestic Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external financiers is how Thai law treats overseas ownership of businesses, and what additional criteria come into play when hiring international staff or having non-domestic executives. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Overseas Shareholding Limits – The Non-domestic Venture Act: The Non-domestic Operation Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting non-domestic ownership in Thailand businesses
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a firm is considered “external” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is international-owned (for juristic members)
siam-regulatory.com
. Non-domestic firms are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain venture activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thailand majority organization.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where external involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thai enterprises are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. Non-domestic-majority organizations cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Overseas Operation License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal venture activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service operation,” requiring a license if international-owned beyond 49%. If your business is majority Thailand-owned (51% or more Thai stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand entity without those restrictions
siam-regulatory.com
. This is why some non-domestic shareholders opt for Thailand-based partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand-based members (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thailand nationals from acting as strawmen for external control
Thai-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of businesses under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Both the Thai proxy and external beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thailand-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thailand-based partners in your organization are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% external ownership in a restricted enterprise, here are lawful pathways:

Obtain a International Venture License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Non-domestic Venture Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your venture should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thai employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many external firms do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your enterprise is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved firms can be 100% overseas-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic External Enterprise Certificate. However, BOI firms must meet specific project criteria and are limited to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand-based Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a organization in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-regulatory.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your venture activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority business doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned enterprise is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of operation to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the operation into a Thai entity for restricted parts and a non-domestic entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring International Staff: To legally work in Thailand, international nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand liability-limited firm can sponsor work permits for overseas board members, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The organization must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per non-domestic work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the external employee is married to a Thailand-based)

. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The business must employ 4 Thailand full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 international work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per organization for standard businesses (meaning after 40 Thailand employees and 10 foreigners, the firm would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The business should be fully registered and operating, with a real commercial endeavor address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new organizations, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Taxation ID and VAT recording if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Organizations with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thailand-based employee rule (BOI businesses can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thai, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand
airswift.com
. The firm then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required forms include the business papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience paperwork of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the business they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The firm must continue to meet the Thailand-based employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a business would hire an expat for.

For international managers who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign filings or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many non-domestic board members choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a venture visa.

Hiring External Employees: When hiring a non-domestic employee (aside from executives), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of obligations. The enterprise must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand liability-limited firm can indeed hire foreigners and have external managers, but it must maintain a substantial operation presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have international board members living in Thailand, plan your organization’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a firm in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Stakeholders: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand owners just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand-based authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thai-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the lawful routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority non-domestic ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, enterprise closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your enterprise’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing conditions. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed venture should be lawful for your firm to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for international firms (they expect at least THB 2–3M for international-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-statutory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new operation owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and regulatory headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (executives, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and fiscal payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All firm sign-up forms must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a overseas promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thailand-based embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because records are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thailand-based law.

Mismanaging Thailand-based Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai owners or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thai partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking In-country Advice: Thailand corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated local market resources or lawful advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a external director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum stakeholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-compliance.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a international commercial endeavor license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with fiscal ID numbers, etc. Small organizations sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the operation. Setting up a organization is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Compliance References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key lawful references and resources related to Thailand-based limited businesses:

Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing organizations. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of Ltd. firms. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a limited business as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-lawful.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by partners within 4 months)
library.siam-lawful.com
library.siam-compliance.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific regulatory question on corporate procedures.

External Enterprise Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts overseas ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for overseas stakeholders to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned enterprises. It also provides the regulatory basis for Overseas Commercial endeavor Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in regulatory databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring external investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand-based employee conditions (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the lawful context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for business filing procedures. While much content is in Thailand-based, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online enrollment). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-enrollment portal, and lists of acceptable business objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a External Venture Division page which explains the Non-domestic Operation License application step-by-step approach and needs.

Thailand Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate turnover taxation rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides levy return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for tax-related compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the procedure of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease international ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of criteria (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American organizations on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thai Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for enrollment (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer recording checkpoints and rates.

Lastly, consider consulting reputable law firms’ websites or guides (many have up-to-date articles in English on Thailand organization law). The information in this article has been drawn from current laws and reputable sources, with compliance references provided, to ensure accuracy
