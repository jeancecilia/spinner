Setting Up a Thai Restricted liability Organization (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Manual
Introduction

A Thai Limited Firm (Business Liability-limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common operation structure in Thailand for both within Thailand entrepreneurs and international financiers. It is a private organization form similar to a Ltd. liability organization (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate compliance entity and liability-limited liability for its owners
siam-compliance.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the organization’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is liability-limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-statutory.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thailand Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Commercial endeavor Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees organization filing. External investment is regulated by the International Commercial endeavor Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps international shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this handbook, we focus solely on the Thailand-based Private Ltd. Firm (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, statutory conditions, sign-up stages, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant compliance references for anyone considering establishing a Thailand liability-limited business.

Advantages of a Thailand Limited Firm

A Thailand-based liability-limited business offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing enterprise in Thailand:

Ltd. Liability: Members have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – stakeholders risk only the capital they put into the organization
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the business’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Lawful Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its partners. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct commercial endeavor in its own name without implicating members in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the organization can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The business’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if members change or pass away. The operation can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add stakeholders or raise capital compared to partnerships. New members can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support venture growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thailand Market Access with Overseas Participation: A restricted liability business allows international stakeholders to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-regulatory.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-regulatory.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, international financiers can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thailand-based laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered organization can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for non-domestic employees or executives. Thailand Ltd. businesses are the typical vehicle for obtaining enterprise visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the firm meets certain capital and local market employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI firms or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thai clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal operation presence. Many Thailand-based agencies and large firms prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thai Ltd. enterprise offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling overseas investment and complying with within Thailand ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular operation entity in Thailand.

Lawful Needs for a Thailand Ltd. Organization

Setting up a Thailand-based Co., Ltd. involves meeting several statutory obligations, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key conditions include:

Partners: You need a minimum of 2 partners (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private limited firm
library.siam-regulatory.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-lawful.com
. Stakeholders can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-lawful.com
. Thailand law requires at least two partners to be maintained at all times during the business’s existence – if the number falls below two, the firm may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of owners for a private enterprise, but if you anticipate many stakeholders or public share offering, a public firm structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thailand vs. Non-domestic Ownership: By default, a restricted liability enterprise can be 100% Thailand-based-owned or up to 49% international-owned without special permits
siam-compliance.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the business is considered “international” under the International Operation Act (FBA) and may need a Overseas Commercial endeavor License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-compliance.com
. We will discuss external ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thai shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thai nominee owners (Thailand citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
Thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thailand-based partners is required.

Executives: A Thai Ltd. firm must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the firm
benoit-partners.com
. There is no compliance requirement for a Thailand national to be a director – overseas executives are allowed, though in practice a international director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Executives are elected by the stakeholders and have the authority to bind the enterprise in transactions. The board of executives (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the business and its partners
siam-lawful.com
. The firm’s Articles of Association can specify how many executives constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two board members signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director firm is also very common for small businesses. Managers need not be partners, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thailand-owned firm – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended commercial endeavor and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the organization will employ any international nationals or if it will be majority overseas-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a business needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per non-domestic work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thailand national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a external-majority business often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a International Commercial endeavor License for restricted activities
siam-regulatory.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-statutory.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-regulatory.com
. For example, if you register a organization with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the owners initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thailand-majority enterprises, but for international-majority organizations they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a recording fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Enterprise Name: The enterprise’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Restricted liability” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-statutory.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing businesses. The name may be in Thailand-based or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thailand-based name for filing purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with recording.

Registered Address: Every business must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where enterprise records are kept and compliance notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for filing – typically a copy of the house recording deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the enterprise
siam-compliance.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for sign-up). Note that after incorporation, if the organization moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the firm. The MOA must state: (1) the approved enterprise name, (2) the province where the business will be located, (3) the venture objectives of the organization, (4) a declaration that liability of members is Ltd., (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-regulatory.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the enterprise – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-regulatory.com
. The enterprise objectives can be broad (you can list multiple commercial endeavor activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have external owners, unless you plan to obtain a Non-domestic Operation License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a business may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the organization (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of sign-up (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small businesses in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with lawful advice.

Initial Members and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-compliance.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai firms (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to stakeholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a international individual or business, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate forms for the enrollment workflow.

Board members and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the managers and authorized signatories. Authorized leaders are those who can sign on behalf of the firm (for example, to sign contracts or bank paperwork). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two executives jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the filing application and related filings. Leaders will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a statutory requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the business must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the enterprise’s incorporation paperwork, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by members and authorities. Many firms engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the statutory prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 members, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational paperwork (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital criteria especially if international involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the enterprise sign-up step-by-step approach described next.

Step-by-Step Recording Step-by-step approach

Setting up a Thai limited enterprise involves several sequential checkpoints with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the workflow, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Business Name – The first step is to choose a unique enterprise name and reserve it with the Department of Enterprise Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing business names, and must end in “Ltd.”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 venture days
siam-statutory.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the business using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Venture Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the regulatory criteria, includes the enterprise name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for sign-up. This can be done at the Venture Enrollment office in the province where the firm will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thailand ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA sign-up is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming records are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-regulatory.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-regulatory.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial owners) must be held. If there are only a few stakeholders, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the firm’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Board members is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the business (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thailand law required publishing a notice in a local market newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few owners). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-regulatory.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small businesses, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (stakeholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Business (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the business as a lawful entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for organization enrollment, attaching required forms: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of members, details of the newly appointed executives and their signatory powers, the written consent of the organization’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house recording copy). The executives will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the leaders is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The business recording application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA recording (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-compliance.com
, otherwise the workflow lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the recording usually within 1 enterprise day – you will then receive the Enterprise Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the business’s filing number and Levy ID, and a certified list of stakeholders. Congratulations, at this point the organization legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Taxation ID and Register for VAT – Once the enterprise is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the organization’s Taxation ID number is often the same as its enrollment number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your enterprise expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Fiscal (VAT). The VAT recording is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new organizations). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide paperwork such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the business affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT enrollment should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting venture if required by nature of operation
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main filing, there are a few additional tasks to get your business fully operational:

Social Security Filing: If you will hire employees (Thailand or international), you must register your enterprise as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the firm affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the enterprise seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a regulatory requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your venture, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food commercial endeavor licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For international-majority organizations, if the operation activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Overseas Enterprise License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that commercial endeavor
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Division) and involves a separate application outlining the enterprise plan, justifications, and how the commercial endeavor will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss international operation licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward enterprise can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and firm enrollment (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Sign-up system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like fiscal and VAT. By law, the entire method from MOA to enterprise filing can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online business recording (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the workflow. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thailand language, engaging a regulatory or accounting firm to assist with enrollment is common and can ensure all forms are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thailand restricted liability enterprise is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s tax-related laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Takings Fiscal (CIT): Thailand-based organizations are subject to corporate turnover taxation on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax-related scheme for small businesses: organizations with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and takings ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate levy is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but firms can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate fiscal return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, organizations must file a half-year fiscal return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s tax-related in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year organizations). Any withholding levy the business has paid or that was withheld from payments to the business can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Taxation (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the firm must register under the Value Added Fiscal system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the business needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output levy collected and input tax-related paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Commercial endeavor Levy depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding taxation on certain payments. For example, when your firm pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thai organization, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% levy respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your enterprise pays dividends to members, a 10% withholding taxation is applied (for Thai residents; 10% is also the standard rate for international owners, unless reduced by a fiscal treaty). You must file monthly withholding fiscal returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for firms) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the firm liable for the levy plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the enterprise has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The enterprise needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal revenue tax-related withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a firm maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thailand auditor (CPA)
library.siam-statutory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. Every year, the organization must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of stakeholders within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-statutory.com
. For example, a organization on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-lawful.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual taxation return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for managers and dissolution of the enterprise by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

External Venture License Renewals/Reporting: If your enterprise has a External Operation License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI firms, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the enterprise enjoys any taxation incentives, ensure to comply with their needs.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the enterprise’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of managers, changes of business address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in partners. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a stakeholders’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a members’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thailand-based enterprise comes with monthly compliance (fiscal filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thailand accounting standards and taxation rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thailand-based accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thai language (or with Thailand translations). Good compliance will keep your business in good standing and avoid fines or lawful trouble.

International Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for external shareholders is how Thailand law treats non-domestic ownership of businesses, and what additional obligations come into play when hiring external staff or having non-domestic executives. Below, we address external shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Non-domestic Shareholding Limits – The Overseas Operation Act: The External Venture Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting overseas ownership in Thailand enterprises
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a business is considered “overseas” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is overseas-owned (for juristic stakeholders)
siam-lawful.com
. Non-domestic businesses are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain commercial endeavor activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thai majority organization.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where non-domestic involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general shareholders.

List 3: Activities where Thailand businesses are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. External-majority firms cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Non-domestic Enterprise License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal commercial endeavor activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service commercial endeavor,” requiring a license if international-owned beyond 49%. If your firm is majority Thailand-based-owned (51% or more Thailand stakeholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thailand-based entity without those restrictions
siam-statutory.com
. This is why some external stakeholders opt for Thailand partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thailand owners (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the venture is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thai nationals from acting as strawmen for non-domestic control
Thailand-based-co.com
Thailand-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of organizations under investigation for nominee structures
Thailand-co.com
Thai-co.com
. Both the Thailand proxy and overseas beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
Thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thai stakeholders in your enterprise are genuine backers with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% international ownership in a restricted operation, here are lawful pathways:

Obtain a International Venture License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your enterprise should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thailand employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many non-domestic organizations do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your operation is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved organizations can be 100% non-domestic-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like taxation holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic External Enterprise Certificate. However, BOI businesses must meet specific project criteria and are limited to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thailand Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. organization, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a organization in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-compliance.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-lawful.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your venture activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thailand majority business doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned commercial endeavor is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of commercial endeavor to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the enterprise into a Thailand entity for restricted parts and a international entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring External Staff: To legally work in Thailand, overseas nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thailand-based liability-limited enterprise can sponsor work permits for non-domestic board members, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The organization must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per non-domestic work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the international employee is married to a Thai)
airswift.com
. This is why many organizations that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The organization must employ 4 Thailand-based full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)
airswift.com
, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 overseas work permit, you need 4 Thailand-based staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thailand staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per firm for standard firms (meaning after 40 Thailand employees and 10 foreigners, the enterprise would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The firm should be fully registered and operating, with a real operation address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new organizations, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Taxation ID and VAT enrollment if applicable
airswift.com
.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Businesses with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thai employee rule (BOI organizations can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thailand-based, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thailand employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand

. The business then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required records include the organization papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience records of the foreigner. The method typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok
airswift.com
airswift.com
 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the firm they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and enterprise stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed
airswift.com
.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The enterprise must continue to meet the Thai employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)
airswift.com
 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a organization would hire an expat for.

For international board members who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign forms or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many non-domestic leaders choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a commercial endeavor visa.

Hiring International Employees: When hiring a international employee (aside from managers), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of needs. The organization must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thailand Ltd. firm can indeed hire foreigners and have overseas managers, but it must maintain a substantial venture presence to justify it – real capital, Thailand-based staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have overseas executives living in Thailand, plan your organization’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the non-domestic individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a organization in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Partners: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thailand-based stakeholders just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thailand authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
Thailand-co.com
Thailand-based-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the statutory routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority overseas ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, operation closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your organization’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing criteria. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed commercial endeavor should be lawful for your business to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for overseas firms (they expect at least THB 2–3M for non-domestic-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-regulatory.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new venture owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and lawful headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (leaders, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and tax-related payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All enterprise sign-up records must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a external promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thai embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because paperwork are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thai law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai owners or managers, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thailand-based friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thailand-based partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Within thailand Advice: Thai corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated within Thailand resources or regulatory advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a international director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum stakeholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-compliance.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a external enterprise license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with fiscal ID numbers, etc. Small organizations sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the operation. Setting up a enterprise is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Statutory References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key statutory references and resources related to Thai restricted liability organizations:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing enterprises. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of restricted liability firms. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a liability-limited firm as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability Ltd. to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-statutory.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-statutory.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by partners within 4 months)
library.siam-regulatory.com
library.siam-lawful.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific lawful question on corporate procedures.

Non-domestic Commercial endeavor Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts non-domestic ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for international shareholders to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for overseas-owned businesses. It also provides the regulatory basis for International Enterprise Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in statutory databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including overseas-owned firms), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thai citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring external investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thailand-based employee criteria (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the regulatory context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Operation Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for firm recording procedures. While much content is in Thailand-based, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online filing). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-sign-up portal, and lists of acceptable enterprise objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Non-domestic Operation Division page which explains the International Commercial endeavor License application procedure and obligations.

Thailand Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate takings levy rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides fiscal return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for levy compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the procedure of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease overseas ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of obligations (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American businesses on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thailand-based Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the step-by-step approach typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for filing (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer recording milestones and rates.
