Setting Up a Thai Limited Company (Co., Ltd.): A Comprehensive Guide
Introduction

A Thai Limited Company (Company Limited or Co., Ltd.) is the most common business structure in Thailand for both local entrepreneurs and foreign investors. It is a private company form similar to a limited liability company (LLC) in other jurisdictions, offering a separate legal entity and limited liability for its owners
siam-legal.com
. In a Thai Co., Ltd., the company’s capital is divided into shares and shareholder liability is limited to the unpaid amount on those shares
library.siam-legal.com
. This structure is governed primarily by the Thai Civil and Commercial Code (Sections 1096–1273) and related laws
benoit-partners.com
, along with regulations from the Department of Business Development (DBD) under the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees company registration. Foreign investment is regulated by the Foreign Business Act B.E. 2542 (1999), which generally caps foreign shareholding at 49% in most sectors (unless special exemptions apply)
benoit-partners.com
. In this guide, we focus solely on the Thai Private Limited Company (Co., Ltd.) structure – its benefits, legal requirements, registration steps, taxes, and compliance obligations – providing practical information and relevant legal references for anyone considering establishing a Thai limited company.

Advantages of a Thai Limited Company

A Thai limited company offers several key advantages that make it an attractive choice for doing business in Thailand:

Limited Liability: Shareholders have their liability capped at the amount unpaid on their shares. In practice, this means personal assets are protected – investors risk only the capital they put into the company
benoit-partners.com
. This offers financial security by shielding owners from the company’s debts beyond their share investment.

Separate Legal Entity: A Co., Ltd. is a juristic person separate from its shareholders. It can own assets, enter contracts, and conduct business in its own name without implicating shareholders in those obligations
benoit-partners.com
. This enhances credibility with customers, partners, and banks, as the company can sue and be sued independently of its owners.

Continuity and Transferability: The company’s existence is not tied to any one owner. Shares can be transferred (subject to any Articles of Association restrictions), allowing continuity even if shareholders change or pass away. The business can thus outlive its founders, unlike sole proprietorships or certain partnerships.

Attracting Investment: The share structure makes it easier to add investors or raise capital compared to partnerships. New shareholders can be issued shares in exchange for investment. This flexibility can support business growth and makes it feasible to bring in partners or venture capital.

Thai Market Access with Foreign Participation: A limited company allows foreign investors to participate in Thailand’s market, albeit with restrictions. Foreigners can hold up to 49% of shares in most sectors freely
siam-legal.com
, and even up to 100% in certain cases (such as BOI-promoted industries or under the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity)
siam-legal.com
. Through joint ventures or preference share structures, foreign investors can structure their involvement while remaining compliant with Thai laws
benoit-partners.com
.

Work Permit Eligibility: A registered company can sponsor work permits and long-term visas for foreign employees or executives. Thai limited companies are the typical vehicle for obtaining business visas and work permits for foreigners, provided the company meets certain capital and local employment ratios (discussed below). This makes it the only practical form (aside from BOI companies or representative offices) for foreigners who wish to work and reside in Thailand legally.

Reputation and Commercial Credibility: Operating as a Co., Ltd. lends credibility when dealing with Thai clients, government agencies, and suppliers. It shows commitment to a formal business presence. Many Thai agencies and large companies prefer or even require dealing with corporate entities rather than unregistered businesses.

In summary, the Thai limited company offers a combination of liability protection, flexibility, and market access that is well-suited for businesses of all sizes – from startups to multinational subsidiaries
benoit-partners.com
. It strikes a balance between enabling foreign investment and complying with local ownership rules, which is why it remains the most popular business entity in Thailand.

Legal Requirements for a Thai Limited Company

Setting up a Thai Co., Ltd. involves meeting several legal requirements, as prescribed by the Civil and Commercial Code (CCC) and related regulations. Key requirements include:

Shareholders: You need a minimum of 2 shareholders (known as promoters at incorporation) to form a private limited company
library.siam-legal.com
. This was reduced from a three-person minimum by a 2022 amendment effective Feb 2023
library.siam-legal.com
. Shareholders can be individuals or juristic entities of any nationality, except that the initial promoters who sign the Memorandum must be natural persons aged at least 20 years old (capable of contractual capacity)
siam-legal.com
. Thai law requires at least two shareholders to be maintained at all times during the company’s existence – if the number falls below two, the company may face dissolution by court order
benoit-partners.com
. There is no maximum number of shareholders for a private company, but if you anticipate many shareholders or public share offering, a public company structure would be required (not covered here). For most small-to-medium enterprises, the shareholder count remains modest.

Thai vs. Foreign Ownership: By default, a limited company can be 100% Thai-owned or up to 49% foreign-owned without special permits
siam-legal.com
. If foreigners will hold a majority (>49%), the company is considered “foreign” under the Foreign Business Act (FBA) and may need a Foreign Business License to operate in certain restricted sectors
siam-legal.com
. We will discuss foreign ownership rules in detail later, but it is important to note at the outset that at least 51% Thai shareholding is required if you want to avoid FBA licensing in regulated industries. Using Thai nominee shareholders (Thai citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners to evade the FBA limits) is illegal and subject to heavy penalties (up to 3 years imprisonment and a THB 1 million fine under the FBA)
thai-co.com
 – genuine investment by any Thai partners is required.

Directors: A Thai limited company must appoint at least one director (who can be of any nationality) to manage the company
benoit-partners.com
. There is no legal requirement for a Thai national to be a director – foreign directors are allowed, though in practice a foreign director will need a valid work permit and visa to perform duties in Thailand
benoit-partners.com
. Directors are elected by the shareholders and have the authority to bind the company in transactions. The board of directors (which can be a single director or multiple) has fiduciary duties to act in the best interest of the company and its shareholders
siam-legal.com
. The company’s Articles of Association can specify how many directors constitute a quorum and any limitations on their power. It’s common to require two directors signing jointly for certain actions, as a checks-and-balances measure, though a single-director company is also very common for small businesses. Directors need not be shareholders, and can be changed by shareholder resolution.

Registered Capital: There is no statutory minimum capital for a Thai-owned company – in theory you could register with a very small capital (even 100 baht, though each share must be at least 5 baht par value by law
benoit-partners.com
). However, in practice the registered capital should be “adequate” for the intended business and expenses
benoit-partners.com
. Notably, if the company will employ any foreign nationals or if it will be majority foreign-owned, certain minimum capital thresholds apply. Under the Alien Employment Act and immigration regulations, a company needs at least THB 2 million in registered capital (fully registered) per foreign work permit sponsored (or THB 1 million per work permit if the foreigner is married to a Thai national)
airswift.com
. Likewise, a foreign-majority company often must have a minimum capital of THB 3 million or more to obtain a Foreign Business License for restricted activities
siam-legal.com
. All proposed shares must be subscribed before incorporation (you cannot register an incomplete share offering)
library.siam-legal.com
, and at least 25% of the par value of each share must be paid as the first installment per the CCC
library.siam-legal.com
. For example, if you register a company with THB 1 million capital (100,000 shares at 10 THB each), at least THB 250,000 must be paid in by the shareholders initially. In practice, the Ministry of Commerce doesn’t usually require proof of this payment for Thai-majority companies, but for foreign-majority companies they may require evidence of funds. The government also charges a registration fee of approximately THB 5,500 per million baht of capital (the fee is 550 THB per 100k THB of capital).

Company Name: The company’s name must be unique and must end with the word “Limited” as required by Section 1098 of the Civil and Commercial Code
siam-legal.com
library.siam-legal.com
. The name reservation is the first step in incorporation (discussed below), where you submit 2-3 name choices to the DBD. Certain words are prohibited in names (for example, “Royal” or terms suggesting government affiliation), and the name cannot duplicate or closely resemble existing companies. The name may be in Thai or another language, but if in Roman letters it should roughly transliterate to a Thai name for registration purposes. Once approved, the reserved name is valid for a period (often 30 days) to proceed with registration.

Registered Address: Every company must have a registered office address in Thailand. This is the official location where company records are kept and legal notices may be served. It can be an owned or rented office, or even your home address if allowed in that zone, but P.O. boxes are not acceptable. You will need to provide proof of the address for registration – typically a copy of the house registration deed (Tabien Baan) for the property and a written consent from the owner/landlord allowing the use of the address for the company
siam-legal.com
. If using a serviced office or virtual office, ensure it comes with proper documentation and DBD acceptance (some virtual offices are pre-approved for registration). Note that after incorporation, if the company moves to a new address, you must file an address change with the DBD within 14 days.

Memorandum of Association (MOA): The promoters must prepare a Memorandum of Association which is a foundational document of the company. The MOA must state: (1) the approved company name, (2) the province where the company will be located, (3) the business objectives of the company, (4) a declaration that liability of shareholders is limited, (5) the amount of registered capital and number of shares (with par value), and (6) the names, addresses, and signatures of the promoters and number of shares each subscribes
library.siam-legal.com
library.siam-legal.com
. The MOA is essentially an application to register the company – it gets filed with the DBD. At least two promoters must sign the MOA and their signatures must be witnessed by two witnesses
library.siam-legal.com
. The company objectives can be broad (you can list multiple business activities), but they should not include any activities prohibited to foreigners if you intend to have foreign shareholders, unless you plan to obtain a Foreign Business License. The DBD provides standard objective templates that cover most common businesses.

Articles of Association (Bylaws): In addition to the MOA, a company may (and typically does) have Articles of Association which outline the internal governance of the company (e.g. how meetings are called, voting rights, director powers, dividend policy, etc.). You can file custom Articles at the time of registration (often done at the statutory meeting). If none are filed, the default provisions of the CCC apply. Most small companies in Thailand use relatively standard Articles aligned with the CCC’s framework. Any special arrangements (like different share classes, etc.) should be drafted in the Articles with legal advice.

Initial Shareholders and Shares: Each promoter (initial shareholder) must subscribe to at least one share
library.siam-legal.com
. There is no bearer share allowed in Thai companies (shares must be registered to specific owners by name). Par value per share must be at least THB 5
benoit-partners.com
. Share certificates should be issued to shareholders after incorporation. If any shareholder is a foreign individual or company, they will need to provide copies of passports or corporate documents for the registration process.

Directors and Signatories: When registering, you will need to list the directors and authorized signatories. Authorized directors are those who can sign on behalf of the company (for example, to sign contracts or bank documents). You can specify the signing condition (e.g. any one director signs alone, or two directors jointly, etc.). At least one director’s signature is required to certify the registration application and related filings. Directors will also have to sign a declaration that they are qualified and not bankrupt or convicted of certain offenses.

Corporate Secretary and Registered Records: While not a legal requirement to appoint a corporate secretary, the company must maintain certain statutory records at the registered office. This includes the shareholder register, minutes of shareholder and board meetings, the company’s incorporation documents, and financial statements. These must be available for inspection by shareholders and authorities. Many companies engage an accounting or law firm to handle these corporate secretarial tasks.

In summary, the legal prerequisites for a Thai Co., Ltd. involve getting the right people (at least 2 shareholders, 1 director, etc.), deciding on a compliant name and objectives, preparing the foundational documents (MOA and possibly Articles), having an address in Thailand, and ensuring you meet capital requirements especially if foreign involvement is planned. All these pieces come together in the company registration process described next.

Step-by-Step Registration Process

Setting up a Thai limited company involves several sequential steps with different authorities. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of the process, along with typical timelines and the relevant government offices involved:

Step 1: Reserve a Company Name – The first step is to choose a unique company name and reserve it with the Department of Business Development (DBD). You can do this online through the DBD’s name reservation system
benoit-partners.com
 or in person at the DBD. Provide up to 3 name choices in order of preference. The name must follow DBD guidelines (no prohibited terms, not identical or too similar to existing company names, and must end in “Limited”). The DBD will typically approve a name within 1–3 business days
siam-legal.com
. Once approved, the name reservation is usually valid for 30 days, during which you should proceed to register the company using that name (it can be extended for a small fee if necessary). Authority: Department of Business Development, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 2: File the Memorandum of Association (MOA) – With a reserved name, the promoters (at least 2 individuals) must prepare and sign the Memorandum of Association. This document, as described in the legal requirements, includes the company name, registered address, objectives, share capital details, and promoters’ information
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. All promoters sign the MOA in the presence of two witnesses. You then submit the MOA to the DBD for registration. This can be done at the Business Registration office in the province where the company will be located, or online via the DBD e-Filing system (if you have a Thai ID or DBD account – foreigners often have an agent do this). Timeline: The MOA registration is usually completed on the same day of filing, assuming documents are in order. At this stage, all shares must be subscribed (promoters commit to their shareholding)
library.siam-legal.com
, though actual payment on shares can be as low as 25% of par value initially
library.siam-legal.com
. Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 3: Convene the Statutory Meeting – After the MOA is registered (or concurrently, in practice), a statutory meeting of subscribers (the initial shareholders) must be held. If there are only a few shareholders, this meeting can be done immediately or even by circulating a resolution for signature. In a larger setup, a physical meeting is called. At the statutory meeting, the company’s Articles of Association (if any) are adopted, the number of shares to be allotted to each subscriber is confirmed (often the promoters simply confirm the shares they subscribed in the MOA), and the official Board of Directors is appointed
benoit-partners.com
benoit-partners.com
. An auditor is also typically appointed at this meeting as required by law. The meeting will also ratify the incorporation expenses and any contracts entered by promoters on behalf of the company (usually none in a simple setup). Notice: Formerly, Thai law required publishing a notice in a local newspaper to call this meeting, but this requirement was removed in 2023 for most cases
nortonrosefulbright.com
 – now written notice to subscribers is sufficient except in special cases like issuing bearer shares (which are uncommon)
nortonrosefulbright.com
. You must record minutes of this meeting, which will be submitted to the DBD. Timeline: The statutory meeting can be held on the same day the MOA is registered if all subscribers agree (commonly the case when there are few shareholders). Otherwise, you might give 7 days’ notice (as per CCC Section 1107)
library.siam-legal.com
 to the subscribers, but practically for small companies, immediate meeting minutes are accepted. Authority: Internal meeting (shareholders), but minutes are filed to DBD.

Step 4: Register the Company (Incorporation) – With the statutory meeting done, you proceed to formally register the company as a legal entity with the DBD. You must submit an application for company registration, attaching required documents: the approved Name Reservation, the signed Memorandum of Association, the Statutory Meeting minutes, the Articles of Association (if any), the list of shareholders, details of the newly appointed directors and their signatory powers, the written consent of the company’s auditor, and the proof of registered address (owner consent letter and house registration copy). The directors will sign various affidavits – for example, confirming they are not disqualified from directorship, and accepting their appointment. One of the directors is usually authorized to sign the application for incorporation. Timeline: The company registration application must be filed within 3 months of the MOA registration (and within 90 days of the statutory meeting as per law)
siam-legal.com
, otherwise the process lapses and you’d have to start over. In practice, most people file the incorporation either the same day as the MOA or within a few days. The DBD processes the registration usually within 1 business day – you will then receive the Company Affidavit (certificate of incorporation), the company’s registration number and Tax ID, and a certified list of shareholders. Congratulations, at this point the company legally exists! Authority: DBD, Ministry of Commerce.

Step 5: Obtain Tax ID and Register for VAT – Once the company is formed, you need to ensure it is registered with the Revenue Department. In many cases, the DBD now coordinates with the Revenue Department to issue a Taxpayer Identification Number automatically upon incorporation (the company’s Tax ID number is often the same as its registration number). However, you or your accountant should verify this and register with the Revenue Department within 60 days of incorporation to be certain (especially if the automatic system did not apply). If your company expects to have annual gross revenue over THB 1.8 million, or if it will engage in activities requiring VAT (import/export, etc.), it must register for Value Added Tax (VAT). The VAT registration is done at the Revenue Department (or sometimes at a Ministry of Commerce one-stop service center for new companies). You must file a VAT application (Form VAT 01) and provide documents such as the lease agreement of the office, photos of the office, the company affidavit and director’s ID, etc. VAT registration should be completed within 30 days of reaching THB 1.8M in sales or before starting business if required by nature of business
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. Once registered, you will get a VAT certificate and need to start filing VAT returns (form PP30) monthly. If your sales will be under 1.8M and you prefer not to register for VAT, you may remain exempt as a “small entrepreneur”
rd.go.th
 – but note you cannot charge VAT to clients in that case. Authorities: Revenue Department (Ministry of Finance).

Step 6: Post-Incorporation Tasks – After the main registration, there are a few additional tasks to get your company fully operational:

Social Security Registration: If you will hire employees (Thai or foreign), you must register your company as an employer with the Social Security Office and enroll your employees in the social security fund within 30 days of hiring the first employee.

Opening a Bank Account: You’ll likely want a corporate bank account. To open one, banks require the company affidavit, director’s identification and authorization, the company seal (if any), and sometimes a board resolution. Many banks in Thailand require the director(s) to be physically present to open the account. This step is not a legal requirement, but practically essential.

Licenses and Permits: Depending on your business, you may need additional licenses. For example, restaurants need food business licenses, factories need factory permits, schools need Ministry of Education approval, etc. For foreign-majority companies, if the business activity is restricted under the FBA, you must apply for a Foreign Business License (FBL) or certificate before commencing that business
benoit-partners.com
. The FBL is obtained from the Ministry of Commerce (DBD’s Foreign Business Division) and involves a separate application outlining the business plan, justifications, and how the business will benefit Thailand (timeline for FBL can be 2–4 months or more). We discuss foreign business licensing more in the next section.

Timeline Summary: In general, a straightforward company can be incorporated in about 1–2 weeks: a few days for name reservation, a day for MOA and company registration (which can now be done on the same day in one go, especially with the new DBD e-Registration system going digital
silklegal.com
), and a few more days for post-incorporation tasks like tax and VAT. By law, the entire process from MOA to company registration can span up to 3 months, but it’s advisable to complete it as soon as possible to avoid any expiration of your name reservation or MOA. Note that as of 2025, Thailand is phasing in fully online company registration (DBD Biz Portal) aiming for 100% digital filings by 2026
silklegal.com
, which should further speed up the process. If you’re unfamiliar with the system or Thai language, engaging a legal or accounting firm to assist with registration is common and can ensure all documents are correctly prepared.

Taxation and Ongoing Compliance

Once your Thai limited company is up and running, it must comply with Thailand’s tax laws and corporate governance rules. The key ongoing obligations include:

Corporate Income Tax (CIT): Thai companies are subject to corporate income tax on their net profits. The standard CIT rate is 20% of net profits
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. Thailand has a progressive tax scheme for small businesses: companies with paid-up capital ≤ THB 5 million and income ≤ THB 30 million enjoy reduced rates on the first portions of profit (0% on the first THB 300k, 15% on the next THB 300k to 3 million, and 20% on profits above 3 million)
taxsummaries.pwc.com
taxsummaries.pwc.com
. (These thresholds effectively benefit small and medium enterprises (SMEs)). Corporate tax is assessed on a yearly basis. The typical fiscal year is the calendar year, but companies can choose a different fiscal year. An annual corporate tax return (Form PND 50) must be filed within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year, accompanied by audited financial statements. Additionally, companies must file a half-year tax return (Form PND 51) around mid-year, paying an estimated half of the year’s tax in advance (due by end of August for calendar-year companies). Any withholding tax the company has paid or that was withheld from payments to the company can be credited against the CIT. Timely filing and payment are important to avoid penalties.

Value Added Tax (VAT): As noted, if annual revenue exceeds THB 1.8 million, the company must register under the Value Added Tax system. VAT is 7% in Thailand (this rate has been maintained for many years)
rd.go.th
. Under VAT, the company needs to file monthly VAT returns (Form PP30) by the 15th of the following month, reporting output tax collected and input tax paid. The difference results in either a payment or a credit/refund. Even in months with no sales, a nil return must be filed. Certain businesses are exempt from VAT (e.g. educational services, domestic transportation, medical services)
rd.go.th
, in which case you would not register for VAT but possibly be under Specific Business Tax depending on the activity. It’s crucial to monitor your revenue and register for VAT within 30 days of crossing the threshold to avoid fines
avalara.com
.

Withholding Taxes: Thailand employs a system of withholding tax on certain payments. For example, when your company pays rent to an individual or service fees to a Thai company, it may need to withhold 5% or 3% tax respectively and remit it to the Revenue Department. Likewise, if your company pays dividends to shareholders, a 10% withholding tax is applied (for Thai residents; 10% is also the standard rate for foreign shareholders, unless reduced by a tax treaty). You must file monthly withholding tax returns (Form PND 3 for individuals, PND 53 for companies) by the 7th of each month for any taxes withheld in the previous month. Failing to withhold when required can make the company liable for the tax plus penalties.

Social Security and Payroll: If the company has employees, it must enroll in the social security system. Both the employer and employees contribute 5% of wages (up to a wage cap of THB 15,000) to the Social Security Fund each month. The company needs to file monthly social security contributions by the 15th of the following month (Form สปส.1-10). Also, personal income tax withholding (Form PND 1) on employees’ salaries must be filed monthly, and an annual reconciliation (PND 1ก) filed at year-end. These are routine if you have a payroll.

Accounting and Auditing: Thai law requires that a company maintain proper books of accounts and prepare annual financial statements. Importantly, the financial statements (balance sheet and profit/loss) must be audited by a licensed Thai auditor (CPA)
library.siam-legal.com
library.siam-legal.com
. Every year, the company must hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) of shareholders within 4 months from the end of its fiscal year to approve the audited financial statements
library.siam-legal.com
. For example, a company on calendar year must hold an AGM by April 30 each year. The audited financial statements, along with an annual corporate report (Form Sor.Bor.Chor.3), must then be submitted to the DBD within 1 month of the AGM approval (and in any case no later than 5 months from fiscal year end)
library.siam-legal.com
. Additionally, a copy of the financial statements and an annual tax return must be filed with the Revenue Department. These filings can now be done online via DBD’s e-filing portal and the Revenue Department e-filing. Failure to file annual accounts can result in late fees and, if greatly delayed, criminal penalties for directors and dissolution of the company by the government, so it’s vital to comply with this annual requirement.

Foreign Business License Renewals/Reporting: If your company has a Foreign Business License or BOI Certificate, there will be additional compliance such as annual reports to the Ministry of Commerce on compliance with license conditions, and for BOI companies, regular reporting to the BOI on the project’s progress and meeting of investment conditions. Similarly, if the company enjoys any tax incentives, ensure to comply with their requirements.

Other Ongoing Duties: Any changes in the company’s structure must be reported and registered. This includes changes of directors, changes of company address, any alteration of objectives, increasing or reducing capital, or changes in shareholders. Most such changes must be registered with the DBD within 14 or 30 days of the change and may require special resolutions at a shareholders’ meeting. For instance, adding a new shareholder through transfer requires filing an updated shareholder list (Bor.Or.Jor.5 form) with the DBD. Major changes like capital increases or amendments to the Articles require a special resolution (with 75% approval) at a shareholders’ meeting and DBD approval.

In summary, running a Thai company comes with monthly compliance (tax filings, VAT, social security) and yearly compliance (audited financials and meetings). It’s highly advisable to hire a qualified accountant or accounting firm familiar with Thai accounting standards and tax rules to handle your bookkeeping and filings. Thai accounting standards largely align with IFRS for SMEs, and records must be kept in Thai language (or with Thai translations). Good compliance will keep your company in good standing and avoid fines or legal trouble.

Foreign Ownership and Work Permits

One of the most important considerations for foreign investors is how Thai law treats foreign ownership of companies, and what additional requirements come into play when hiring foreign staff or having foreign directors. Below, we address foreign shareholding restrictions, ways to legally exceed them, and the work permit rules for employing foreigners.

Foreign Shareholding Limits – The Foreign Business Act: The Foreign Business Act (FBA) of 1999 is the key law restricting foreign ownership in Thai companies
benoit-partners.com
. Under the FBA, a company is considered “foreign” if more than 49% of its shares are owned by non-Thais, or if a majority of its capital is foreign-owned (for juristic shareholders)
siam-legal.com
. Foreign companies are prohibited or restricted from engaging in certain business activities listed in three schedules of the FBA:

List 1: Activities absolutely prohibited to foreigners (e.g. newspaper publishing, farming, land trading, etc.). Foreigners cannot engage in these at all, even with a Thai majority company.

List 2: Activities related to national safety or culture (e.g. arms production, historical artifact trading, etc.), where foreign involvement requires special permission from the Cabinet. These are rare and usually not relevant to general investors.

List 3: Activities where Thai companies are deemed not ready to compete with foreigners, including most service businesses, trading, construction, advertising, etc. This is the broad category that captures many common businesses. Foreign-majority companies cannot engage in List 3 activities without obtaining a Foreign Business License from the Ministry of Commerce.

In practice, many normal business activities (consulting services, trading, restaurants, etc.) fall under List 3 “service business,” requiring a license if foreign-owned beyond 49%. If your company is majority Thai-owned (51% or more Thai shareholders), it is exempt from the FBA and can operate like any Thai entity without those restrictions
siam-legal.com
. This is why some foreign investors opt for Thai partners or spouses owning 51% of shares. However, using nominal Thai shareholders (“nominees”) just to meet the 51% requirement while the foreigners actually fund the business is illegal – Section 36 of the FBA explicitly bans Thai nationals from acting as strawmen for foreign control
thai-co.com
thai-co.com
. Recent crackdowns in 2024–2025 have increased scrutiny on such arrangements, with hundreds of companies under investigation for nominee structures
thai-co.com
thai-co.com
. Both the Thai proxy and foreign beneficiary can face severe penalties if caught
thai-co.com
. Bottom line: ensure any Thai shareholders in your company are genuine investors with actual funding proportional to their shares.

If you wish to legally have >49% foreign ownership in a restricted business, here are legal pathways:

Obtain a Foreign Business License (FBL): This involves applying to the DBD’s Foreign Business Committee for permission. You must demonstrate why your business should be allowed (e.g. it provides technology or benefits to Thailand). They often impose conditions (minimum Thai employees, capital ≥ THB 3 million, etc.). Processing can take a few months and approval is not guaranteed, but many foreign companies do obtain FBLs for consulting, software, or other services.

Obtain Board of Investment (BOI) Promotion: If your business is in certain promoted sectors (manufacturing, tech, export, etc.), you can apply for BOI investment promotion. BOI-approved companies can be 100% foreign-owned regardless of FBA lists and enjoy other perks like tax holidays
benoit-partners.com
. BOI status effectively gives you an automatic Foreign Business Certificate. However, BOI companies must meet specific project criteria and are limited to the scope of their approved project.

Use the U.S.–Thai Treaty of Amity: If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. company, the 1966 Treaty of Amity allows you to own 100% of a company in Thailand in most sectors (except a few like communications, transport, and banking)
siam-legal.com
. You must still register under the Treaty at the Ministry of Commerce to get a certificate, but it exempts you from the FBA restrictions
siam-legal.com
. Note this benefit is only for Americans (or entities 50%+ owned by Americans).

Other Treaty/FTA exceptions: Certain other free trade agreements (like ASEAN frameworks) provide exceptions in specific sectors – these are less common and usually sector-specific.

If your business activity is not restricted by the FBA (for example, many manufacturing activities for export are not restricted, or a Thai majority company doing domestic trading), then a foreigner can own any percentage up to 49% freely, or even 100% if the activity is unregulated. Always consult the FBA lists or a lawyer to see if your planned business is on the restricted list. Many times, structuring the scope of business to avoid restricted activities (or splitting the business into a Thai entity for restricted parts and a foreign entity for unrestricted parts) can be a solution.

Work Permits and Hiring Foreign Staff: To legally work in Thailand, foreign nationals (with few exceptions) must hold a valid work permit issued by the Ministry of Labour. A Thai limited company can sponsor work permits for foreign directors, managers, or employees, but it must meet certain criteria:

The company must have at least THB 2,000,000 in paid-up capital per foreign work permit (or THB 1M per permit if the foreign employee is married to a Thai)
airswift.com
. This is why many companies that plan to hire even one foreigner choose to register with at least 2M capital from the start.

The company must employ 4 Thai full-time employees for each work permit (4:1 ratio)

, who should be enrolled in the social security system. For example, to get 1 foreign work permit, you need 4 Thai staff; for 2 foreigners, 8 Thai staff, etc. There is generally a cap of 10 work permits per company for standard companies (meaning after 40 Thai employees and 10 foreigners, the company would need special approval or BOI status for more)
airswift.com
.

The company should be fully registered and operating, with a real business address, and should have filed at least one VAT return or financial statement as evidence of activity (for new companies, sometimes an explanation is needed if no filings yet). It also must have a valid Tax ID and VAT registration if applicable

.

The above rules are the general Ministry of Labour guidelines. Companies with BOI promotion are exempt from the 2M capital and 4 Thai employee rule (BOI companies can often get work permits for foreigners with more ease, sometimes even before hiring any Thais, depending on BOI conditions). Additionally, if the foreigner is married to a Thai, as mentioned, the capital requirement is halved and in some cases the Thai employee ratio may be relaxed to 2:1.

To apply for a work permit, the foreigner must first have a Non-Immigrant “B” Visa to enter Thailand

. The company then submits the work permit application at the Ministry of Labour (or a one-stop service center if eligible). Required documents include the company papers (affidavit, shareholder list, VAT certificate), financial statements or capital evidence, the employment contract, and education and experience documents of the foreigner. The process typically takes 7–10 working days in Bangkok

 (can be longer in other provinces). Once approved, the foreigner receives a work permit book/card which specifies their position and the company they can work for. Note: work permits are job-specific – the person can only work in the position and company stated. If they change jobs, a new permit is needed

.

Work permits are usually valid for 1 year (or tied to the length of the visa) and can be renewed annually. The company must continue to meet the Thai employee and capital ratios, or future extensions may be denied. Also, there are certain professions forbidden to foreigners (listed in the Alien Employment Act and subsequent regulations)

 – e.g. manual labor, agriculture, hairdresser, etc. – though those wouldn’t typically be positions a company would hire an expat for.

For foreign directors who do not actively work (e.g. an overseas investor who is on the board but not living or working in Thailand), a work permit may not be strictly needed if they do not perform any work in Thailand. However, if they sign documents or are involved on the ground, technically a work permit is required. Many foreign directors choose to get a work permit to be safe and to facilitate staying in Thailand on a business visa.

Hiring Foreign Employees: When hiring a foreign employee (aside from directors), the criteria remain the same. Additionally, the foreigner should have relevant qualifications for the job (typically a bachelor’s degree and some experience, otherwise the work permit may be questioned for jobs that could be done by Thais). English teaching, for example, has its own set of requirements. The company must also pay the foreigner a minimum salary depending on nationality (for instance, Western nationals must be paid at least 50,000 THB/month to sponsor a work permit, for some other nationalities it’s 35,000 THB, etc., as per immigration police guidelines).

In summary, a Thai limited company can indeed hire foreigners and have foreign managers, but it must maintain a substantial business presence to justify it – real capital, Thai staff, and compliance with immigration/work laws. If you anticipate needing to hire foreigners or have foreign directors living in Thailand, plan your company’s capital and hiring accordingly from the beginning. Ensure timely renewal of visas and work permits; otherwise, overstays or illegal working can result in fines or even blacklisting of the foreign individual.

Tips and Common Mistakes

Forming and running a company in Thailand can be straightforward with the right preparation, but there are common pitfalls to avoid. Here are some tips and mistakes to watch out for:

Avoid Nominee Shareholders: As emphasized earlier, do not use “dummy” Thai shareholders just to satisfy the majority ownership rule. This might be tempting if you want full control, but it’s illegal (Section 36, FBA) and Thai authorities are actively cracking down on such arrangements
thai-co.com
thai-co.com
. If you don’t have a genuine Thai partner, consider the legal routes (FBL, BOI, Treaty of Amity) to get majority foreign ownership, or stick to 49%. Using nominees risks severe penalties, business closure, and deportation of foreigners involved.

Choosing the Right Objectives and Licenses: When drafting your company’s objectives for the MOA, ensure they align with what you plan to do, and be aware of licensing requirements. A common mistake is listing too broad an objective (e.g. including items that fall under regulated industries), which can flag your application for FBA issues. Only include activities you genuinely intend to conduct. If an objective falls under a regulated field (education, tourism, medical, etc.), be prepared to obtain the necessary license from the relevant ministry after incorporation. It’s easier to include an objective from the start than to add later, but each listed business should be lawful for your company to engage in.

Underestimating Capital Needs: Registering with a very low capital (just to save on fees) can backfire. If you need a work permit, or if you want to show credibility to clients/suppliers, a higher capital is better. Moreover, banks in Thailand often look at registered capital when deciding on loans or even opening accounts. Under-capitalization might also raise questions from the DBD for foreign companies (they expect at least THB 2–3M for foreign-majority firms even if not legally mandated, per practice
siam-legal.com
). It’s advisable to have a capital that realistically supports your initial operations. You don’t have to fully pay it immediately (beyond 25% initially), but you should plan to inject funds as needed.

Not Keeping Up with Compliance: A very common mistake by new business owners is neglecting ongoing compliance – e.g. forgetting to file monthly taxes or the annual financial statement. This can lead to fines and legal headaches. Hire a professional accountant early on, and set reminders for all key filing deadlines. Remember that you need to renew things like corporate insurance, licenses, or permits annually (if applicable) and update the DBD of any changes (directors, address, etc.). Staying in good standing will also be crucial if you later need to prove compliance (for instance, when applying for work permit renewals or visas, they often ask for financial reports and tax payment proof).

Improper Document Execution: All company registration documents must be signed (and sometimes stamped) correctly. If a foreign promoter or director is not in Thailand to sign, you’ll need a power of attorney appointing someone to sign on their behalf, and that POA itself must be notarized by a Notary Public and authenticated by a Thai embassy if done abroad. Many delays happen because documents are not properly signed or legalized. Engage a corporate services firm if you’re unsure how to navigate document formalities.

Ignoring Employment Rules: If you hire staff, be aware of Thailand’s labor laws – you need proper employment contracts, you must adhere to minimum wages, provide Social Security, and comply with overtime and holiday regulations under the Labour Protection Act. Unlawful termination or not contributing to Social Security can cause disputes or penalties. It’s wise to have standard HR policies aligned with Thai law.

Mismanaging Thai Partner Relationships: If you do have Thai shareholders or directors, ensure clear agreements are in place about roles and profit sharing. Sometimes foreigners give 51% to a Thai friend without formal arrangements, which can lead to disputes or even the Thai partner taking control. Use shareholder agreements to clarify any nominee-like loans or actual ownership intentions – but again, note that formal nominee agreements are not enforceable if they violate the law. It’s best to only partner with trustworthy individuals and keep everything above board.

Not Seeking Local Advice: Thai corporate law and procedure, while straightforward, have their quirks. It’s a mistake to rely solely on generic information or assume it’s the same as your home country. Always consult updated local resources or legal advisors, especially if you plan something unconventional (like creating different share classes, or having a foreign director with no work permit, etc.). Laws do change (for example, the minimum shareholders rule changed in 2023
library.siam-legal.com
), and authorities may have internal policies that outsiders aren’t aware of.

Timeline Misconceptions: Don’t assume you can get everything done last-minute. While incorporation itself is quick, certain tasks like opening a bank account (which may require you to have your work permit in hand at some banks) or obtaining a foreign business license (which takes months) can slow down your ability to operate. Plan the timeline keeping in mind visa runs (for your non-immigrant B visa) and coordinating all the pieces.

Financial Oversights: Keep accurate accounting from day one. Thailand requires invoices and receipts to be printed in specific formats with tax ID numbers, etc. Small companies sometimes operate informally and then face issues when an audit is needed. Invest early in a decent accounting system or service.

By being mindful of these common issues and proactively managing them, you can save yourself from costly mistakes and focus on growing the business. Setting up a company is not just a one-time task – it’s the beginning of continuous responsibilities as a director/shareholder.

Legal References and Official Resources

For further reading and verification, here are some key legal references and resources related to Thai limited companies:

Thai Civil and Commercial Code (CCC): The primary law governing companies. Relevant sections are Sections 1096–1206, which cover the formation, management, and dissolution of limited companies. For example, CCC Section 1096 defines a limited company as one formed with capital divided into shares and shareholder liability limited to any unpaid share amount
library.siam-legal.com
. Section 1097 (amended in 2022) sets the minimum number of promoters at two
library.siam-legal.com
. Section 1098 lists required contents of the Memorandum of Association
library.siam-legal.com
, and Sections 1196–1199 outline annual accounting and auditing obligations (e.g. balance sheet must be prepared yearly and approved by shareholders within 4 months)
library.siam-legal.com
library.siam-legal.com
. An English translation of these sections can be found in the Thailand Law Library or official translations. It’s advisable to refer to these laws for any specific legal question on corporate procedures.

Foreign Business Act, B.E. 2542 (1999): This law restricts foreign ownership in many businesses. It’s crucial for foreign investors to understand. The law enumerates which businesses are off-limits or restricted for foreign-owned companies. It also provides the legal basis for Foreign Business Licenses and penalties for violations. An English version is available via the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI)
data.opendevelopmentmekong.net
 or in legal databases. Notably, FBA Section 4 defines what constitutes a “foreigner” (including foreign-owned companies), and Section 8 prohibits foreigners from engaging in List 1–3 businesses without permission. Section 36 prohibits nominee arrangements (Thai citizens holding shares on behalf of foreigners). Penalties are outlined in Sections 41-42. Always ensure compliance with this Act when structuring foreign investments in Thailand.

Alien Employment Act, B.E. 2521 (and amendments): This law (and its updates) governs work permits for foreigners. It lists jobs prohibited to foreigners and sets the framework for work permit issuance. While the law itself doesn’t enumerate the capital and Thai employee requirements (those are in regulations/policies), it’s useful to know the legal context. For day-to-day guidance, the Ministry of Labour and Department of Employment websites provide guides on work permit criteria and processes (some in English).

Department of Business Development (DBD): The DBD’s official website
benoit-partners.com
 (dbd.go.th) is a primary resource for company registration procedures. While much content is in Thai, the site has downloadable forms, fee schedules, and news on law changes (like the shift to online registration). The DBD also offers an English language “DBD e-Services” section for certain services. They publish guidelines on how to reserve names, how to use the e-registration portal, and lists of acceptable company objectives. For foreigners, the DBD has a Foreign Business Division page which explains the Foreign Business License application process and requirements.

Thai Revenue Department: The Revenue Department’s English-language site provides useful summaries of VAT and corporate income tax rules. For instance, it confirms the VAT threshold of THB 1.8 million and the current VAT rate
rd.go.th
rd.go.th
. It also provides tax return filing deadlines and sometimes downloadable forms in English. This is a reliable source for tax compliance information.

Board of Investment (BOI): If you are considering BOI promotion, the BOI website (boi.go.th) has English brochures and guidelines for different industries, and explains the process of applying for promotion, as well as the after-care (issuing work permit visas through the One Stop Service Center etc.). A BOI promotion can greatly ease foreign ownership and work permit issues, but it comes with its own set of requirements (minimum investment, mainly).

Treaty of Amity Certification: The U.S. Commercial Service in Bangkok (for the Treaty of Amity) provides guidance for American companies on how to obtain the Treaty of Amity certificate. Thai Ministry of Commerce also has a division handling this. While not an online resource per se, the process typically involves documentation proving American majority ownership and an application to DBD.

Official Forms and Fees: The Ministry of Commerce often publishes the official fees for registration (e.g. 5,500 THB per million capital for incorporation, 50 THB per name reservation, etc.) on their site or gazette. It’s useful to refer to those to know how much government fees to prepare. Likewise, the Social Security Office site (sso.go.th) can be referenced for employer registration steps and rates.
